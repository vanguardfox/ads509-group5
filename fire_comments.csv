I’m giving myself 10 years of my relatively aggressive saving and to finish having kids before I calculate a number. In the meantime, my high savings rate does a couple things.

I set the goal that way because my plan includes a combo of rental income, mutual fund/equities (401ks, IRAs, Roth, brokerage accounts) and other income streams.

Each source of income has different tax implications and the ""lump sum value"" is less important than the income that can be generated. For instance my current rental portfolio has a large market value but also large debt. At some point I'll restructure it and sell the worst performing properties and pay off the debt - this will amount to a drop in my net worth but a huge boost to my income (not to mention effort in managing fewer properties)"

1fqzb0p,What is your fire number? ,KONUG,"864k.

I live in Austria, and my current monthly expenses are around €1,000. This includes rent for a 70m² apartment, insurance, mobility (I live 5 minutes from my office and bike to work), groceries, holidays, hobbies, and more. I have no debts or loans, and I share housing and mobility costs with my girlfriend.

With expenses at €1,000 per month, I estimate that I would need €240,000 invested in ETFs to achieve FIRE, assuming a 5% net IRR (which would provide €1,000 per month).

However, I know I can't count on my expenses staying this low forever. For instance, if my girlfriend and I were to break up, I’d likely need a more expensive apartment. So, I’m estimating future monthly expenses at €1,800. To cover that, I’d need a portfolio of €432,000, which, with a 5% net return, would give me €1,800 per month (€21,600 per year).

That said, I also need to account for the risk of a 50% drawdown from being 100% invested in stocks and ETFs.

This leads me to my target FIRE number of €864,000.

Am I missing anything?

EDIT: I'll probably never stop working entirely. In about five years, I can see myself cutting back to 3-4 days a week. Then, in another 5-10 years, I might reduce further to just 1-2 days a week. This way, I’ll still have some income from work and stay within the social security system."

No children, not married, zero debt, paid off house with super low RE taxes (&lt;500/yr city+county). With real estate how it is, I'm sitting on probably 300k of home equity, but chose to not factor that in to be conservative. In general, I'm at a ""stable"" point in life, where I'm fairly self sufficient and have no big purchase needs, am able to do pretty much all my own maintenance, and live a fairly zen life, find satisfaction in low cost hobbies like gardening, library book reading, trail running, camping, ... so I feel 1M net (excluding paid off house) is a very conservative number for me.

When I started I was aiming for 250k liquid, thought I could live on 8k/yr, but closest I got to that was 12k/yr, without really sacrificing too much. Tracking last 3 years of spending from when I first learned about FIRE proved 8k to be a fallacy for me, so pivoted to 500k liquid which gives me about 5k/yr safety margin vs. my tracked spending average of 15k/yr.

Seattle has it all.  Well, except the healthcare bit. 


Still - when I look around for where else to go that has all this AND is far cheaper, I see Sweden as my top choice. 

The benefit to Sweden is that they have scant wildfires and no volcano/earthquake/tsunami threat either, AND a better chance of being habitable for the next 40-50 years I might potentially be alive.

The pros of staying in the city: insanely good schools, great hospitals, great public transportation, the best food we've ever had just all over the place anytime we want it, great museums, car free, great entertainment, great friends. Why would we move to a MCOL city? The draw to be near family. That's really it. I can't tell you how appealing that is right before having our first kid, but leaving where we are now just isn't going to happen. We have a network of friends in the city and it feels like home where we are now. We've told ourselves we have to figure out where we'll be long term by the time the kid is about 4-5 and really starting to form friendships. It's still a toss up but we're leaning more to staying at this point.

Honestly, our number would probably remain the same regardless of HCOL or MCOL. Suburban life is expensive. Bigger house full of more crap with 2 cars. Not really a cheap life unless you're very intentional about it and I'm not sure how long we could beat away the social pressure to just come on... one more car! One more bedroom!

z5a29v,What is your fire number and how did you arrive at it?,photog_in_nc,"We spent a lot on travel towards the end of our working years. We might have had a beach rental week, a 9-10 day international trip, and a couple weekend or long weekend getaways. So the costs would involve flights (often paying for convenience), hotels/motels, dining out, activities/admissions. In planning for FIRE, we wanted to do a lot of travel, but doing in at the daily rate we used to didn’t work. So we had to figure a way to to take our pre-FIRE budget and stretch it to much longer. So far it’s worked well. A 6 week road trip across the US, camping each night, we spent less than we spend at home. A month+ long bicycle tour across Europe, I used miles to get a free flight, and spent about what I would have for a 9-day trip before. Again, camping really helped keep costs down. I got a room occasionally, but generally away from an expensive tourist area.

Our future plans involve some slow travel. Renting a house for a month or two in Spain, for example. We can get a monthly rate for about what a beach rental week costs at our coast.

Beyond that, in planning for FIRE, I tracked spending for a long while, and made adjustments based on best guess for how things would be once retired. Way less driving, for instance. No more lunch meals out. And less dining out in general because we have so much time to prepare meals. We also have time to hit multiple grocery stores. We made adjustments for having a paid off home, for health insurance (we pay well less for a silver enhanced ACA plan than our portion of our employer plan).

z5a29v,What is your fire number and how did you arrive at it?,kenmcnay,"I use numbers from my quarterly report to determine an average annual budget for the household. During this accumulation period, it includes housing, saving, and charitable contributions, for example, that would change significantly after RE. It's imperfect, but grants a view of the current household situation. 

At this time, I'm anticipating a SWR of 4.5% to cover that average annual budget, so from my recent quarterly report that's around $2.6M as the average annual budget shows around $99K. However, using this method, the numbers change quarterly. Not much, but I do have another sheet that indicates the changes over time.

Around five years ago, I had an average annual budget about $72K and a FIRE number about $1.8M with a different anticipated SWR. As I have watched the numbers change I keep in mind that setting a rigid number too early would have been a poor judgment. Having a growing volume of data enables more prudent planning. 

I anticipate the mortgage will be paid, then replaced by another home, a rental, or a refinance with cash out (or some other scheme for keeping shelter overhead), and the average annual spending for housing now might not match. I anticipate saving much differently, but I have not determined credible numbers to consider for post-RE savings; maybe it would consist of quarterly travel plans or monthly massages. It's undecided, but most likely will become a lower number and more frequently liquidated rather than consistently accumulated. I base charitable giving primarily on income, so post-RE income will introduce a change to that budgetary category. I won't eliminate it, so I'll have to consider and determine my own measure of charitable giving when I no longer use income as a basis. 

Regarding your topic of travel, I have no major travel plans for post-RE lifestyle. I'm seeing my parents travel quite a lot; they have a vacation condo for trips away from home, but also plan lengthy slow travel trips away from home. My dad likes to cruise about once a year. Right now, I don't have a similar zeal for travel and vacation; I don't have a good feeling about a time share condo at all. But, my parents always advised against it too, until retirement. So, I just guess it will change and remain difficult to estimate until that time. 

My suggestion for estimation is to explore your methods of travel. You find the expense shockingly high? Try out other choices. See if it's good enough or enjoyable enough. For example, while I was traveling for business trips, I liked riding Amtrak despite the time. A flight would cost fairly similar and take less time, but I really enjoyed the train rides. I couldn't always afford the time for train travel to business engagements, but I had a few customers that easily enabled train commutes. Unlike my dad, I really don't like cruising. I want to try cycle touring (another response mentioned it); I've already been a bike commuter and bike camping with my kids. I might like cycle touring, but I'm still working on the bikes I intend to ride for touring. I've got to convince someone to join me too, so I've got two bikes I'm working on."

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,JarvisL1859,"While your situation is very unique, it’s very normal to have issues like this in a relationship. And the best thing is to discuss them to figure out the best way forward and to make sure you and your partner fully understand each other and there’s no resentment. 

Ultimately it seems to come down to the fact that you want a more luxurious lifestyle now that your income has risen (which is normal) but your partner does not want a more luxurious lifestyle and his income has not risen (b/c he’s FIRE)

This is some thing I think you guys can prob work out and definitely discussing compromising on lifestyle or redistributing domestic obligations is fair game. Or your partner returning to the workforce at least part-time if he’s open to that. Or you accepting the original simpler lifestyle you both had and saving the extra so you two could FIRE. Or even keeping it the way it is if you think that you can view the stuff you currently have a problem with as a compromise rather than a subsidy (which I think is a valid way to look at it but ultimately that’s up to you). I’m not saying you have to do any of those but those are the options that come to my mind first as things you could discuss in that conversation

I think your perspective is completely valid and a lot of people would feel the way you do. Especially normal people outside of the FIRE world

Trying to put myself in your partner shoes, I can see how he might be frustrated because he is probably looking for a very simple life with FIRE in an HCOL at that income level and now he may fear that you are bringing lifestyle creep. It probably does not feel to him like you all are subsidizing him but rather compromising between the simpler lifestyle he wants and the more luxurious lifestyle you want. He may not think that he should have to take on more domestic responsibilities just because you earn more money if he was happy with your lifestyle when you were earning less money (but this is another thing in relationships that couples should always discuss and be on the same page about so there’s no resentment).

Anyway I know that doesn’t land on a firm conclusion but hopefully that has some food for thought, best of luck to you all and again, know that while your situation is unusual the general problems you were having are very normal"

Most important is to have a shared vision of what good looks like. 
- What does your living situation look like? 
- How often do you go out to eat? 
- How often do you travel? 
- What class of travel? 
- how often do you get new cars?
Etc. 

Then from this you back into the expenses. It’s often easier if you’re already living your desired life such that the expenses are more predictable for your FIRE# but if you’re not, you need to bake in those costs. 

I saw your version of good includes a dishwasher and his does not. Dare I say he’s being totally unreasonable and a dishwasher is absolutely a necessity haha (this also begs the question how would you fund a future potential home purchase? Does the 35k a year he’s using also include saving toward a down payment? 

So once you agree on these things, there may be some non negotiables for you (like the dishwasher) in which case what is it worth to you and can you fund that for yourself? The dishwasher isn’t the best example bc it benefits everyone but maybe for you there’s an annual $5k vacation budget. If he’s unwilling to meet you at that, you have to decide if the money is still worth spending for yourself. Maybe instead of traveling with him, you spend some of that vacation budget for yourself with your friends?


On the other hand if there’s a fundamental mismatch in a lot of these dimensions and you’re not willing to subsidize him, you guys need to split up. It’s bound to fester more resentment as you go. No point in wasting the time!"

3. Realize your incompatibility and break up. "

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,DevilsTreasure,"Don’t have personal experience with your scenario because I’ve actively avoided it.. in my mind, my wife and I will work til we can both fire. If he wants to be your partner, it feels selfish to be retired when he could be working to accelerate your shared time together without the burden of work. Especially since he aimed for “lean” fire. 

Personally, I’d only settle for 50/50 expenses if my partner wanted to retire without me and still keep finances separate. If you’re already proportionally splitting expenses it’s easy for the “lean” person to abuse the dynamic. Finances are also the leading cause of divorce, so tread carefully before you commit."

He seems selfish because he doesn't want to equally contribute and isn't making any accomodations for their partner. It seems like you guys are not financially compatible. He seems content with life currently, and has little consideration how it affects you.

Your options:

1) limit lifestyle to what he can afford and split expenses evenly, aggressively save and then fire as well

 \* My take is you're not willing to do this and you will be resentful for doing something you don't want

2) pay a larger share of everything, save little money, and still be resentful

There is so much in this post. 10 years is a long relationship and it sounds like you already signed the lease and he also might not be keeping up his end of household stuff? I come back to 10 years of relationship, and if it has been good up until now suggest that you don't throw in the towel like some are suggesting.  

I would keep your agreement as you've made it for now with the 60/40 rent and otherwise split everything 50/50 for the next six months or year. Do not subsidize your partner, meet him where he is for a bit. If you really want something, and he doesn't, do it for just yourself. Your wants are valid. This might mean a quality of life that is lower than what you think you want. On the other hand, you might end up perfectly happy. 

If you aren't happy with restricting your lifestyle after six months or a year (there is nothing wrong with that, btw) then you probably aren't financially compatible and it may be time to move on from the relationship. 

Re: Household - if other than the rent you are 50/50 finances then you should be 50/50 housework. And since your partner is no longer working, it would be lovely if they took a bit more on than that (Maybe 60%?). I'm not saying it is a hard and fast rule and I don't think you should keep detailed track, but if you are coming home from work and pulling second shift cleaning and cooking then that is out of balance.  If his FIRE relies on your providing housekeeping services then that doesn't fly either.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,hungryl1kewolf,"When my partner and I met (both now 36), he was working, but had some health stuff come up and needed to stop working. Prior to this, he intentionally set his life up to be as low cost of living as possible. As a result, he had enough saved that he could comfortably live for a year without working. I don't know that he would have formally defined himself as on the FIRE path, but it was an eventual goal. 

I supported him, of course, who wouldn't for a medical need! When that all resolved and he found he was able to continue not working, I started to feel some type of way. I had to seriously interrogate for myself why that felt/seemed so different. A lot of it ended up untangling how we've been socialized, intentionally challenging expectations of others that were in the back of my mind, and considering why we value what we do under capitalism as a whole.

We were early in our relationship and decided we liked each other enough that it was time to have big conversations anyway. I was honest with him about how I was feeling and what my goals/hopes for my life are. I've since found out (thanks to lurking this sub) that I'm more of a baristaFIRE girlie. 

Our financial interests align enough that we decided it's workable. He also is super understanding and let's me openly talk about my frustrations when they do come up and notice I'm feeling some type of way. He doesn't hold it against me at all. We don't live together, but are actively planning to do so; current time-line will align with when I'm debt free and likely ready to batistaFIRE. 

He has since gotten a small monthly income, outside of his savings. This will mean lifestyle adjustments for both of us. He has accepted that I can't 100% gear down as far as he has, but I also know that to meet my financial goals I can't be rigid either. 

ANYWAY. All this to say, the feelings of confusion and resentment are normal and real. It's what you do with those feelings that matter. In my situation, we do have more similar goals then you two, but a very similar clash of the lifestyles. Open, regular, honest communication and flexibility from both halves are the deal breaker."
1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Agile-Figure-8248,"I'll offer my two cents here, with the caveat that I don't know either you or your partner so take it with a grain of salt :p. First, it sounds from your post like some resentment is starting to build on your end - that's probably not great, maybe consider addressing that directly. Could be as simple as ""hey, I'm starting to notice feeling resentful because I'm contributing more financially and driving our quality of life. Can we talk about it and figure out what to do?"". 

To help with this conversation - consider his (hypothetical) perspective: he's always wanted to achieve financial independence at a modest quality of life. A decent-ish apartment, healthy food, modest material goods and little travel. He's happy with this, and the stress that comes with work is nowhere near close to being worth the marginal increases in quality of life additional income could provide. After working and finally achieving financial freedom, you now expect him (implicitly or explicitly) to make more money to help improve your quality of life. This would require that he go back to work, (potentially) decreasing his quality of life significantly, to purchase things that he doesn't see value in, doesn't really benefit from, and would prefer to live without. You see this as jointly increasing your quality of life together and ""accommodating him"", but is that really the case? Does he actually want the same increases in quality of life that you do? 

At the end of the day, your partner just does not make that much money compared to you ($35k/yr) and so will not be able to increase your quality of life financially. You may just have to accept that or move on to find a higher income earner. There's plenty of them out there."

Don’t create new burdens for your partner when FIREing, unless that is well understood and agreed upon ahead of time.

Now this doesn’t mean you need to make the same amount as before.  Some of the employer pay you earned previously was for investments, and now you’re spending investments so you should need less income.  But I mean in any reasonable partnership and household, you have a budget.  Just keep doing your part, will the wife really care where it comes from?  Nothing needs to be complicated here.

1. 50/50 split for all living expenses.  Because his income is lower than yours, this means your overall standard of living will be based on $70K household income rather than $115K, but because your half of the expenses will be low compared with your salary, this should allow you to save more money or allocate more for wants for yourself.
2. 30/70 split for all living expenses based on the difference in your incomes.  This is what a lot of couples do when their incomes are unequal - it allows for a higher standard of living based on the higher total income and allows both people to have money for savings and spending because the living expenses are percentage-based."

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Nomromz,"I'm struggling to see the issue here. Even in marriages there is often an inequitable split of finances because one spouse makes a lot more. Someone will inevitably be ""subsidizing"" the living for someone else in a relationship when finances are shared. There are millions of single income households in the world. There are also millions of households where one partner makes $200k and one partner makes $75k. 

Your partner is contributing 35k/year. In these single family households, the partner who isn't working often contributes in other ways (usually by doing household chores and childcare). 

The only question is whether or not you are okay subsidizing your partner's lifestyle. It sounds to me like your partner was upfront that they would be making 35k/year for essentially the rest of their life. 

This would be completely different if your partner suddenly told you they didn't want to work anymore and all your plans together have changed. 

Good luck OP. Trying to split all costs in an equitable way will be impossible in any relationship with a large disparity in income. Hopefully you guys can come to some sort of compromise where you contribute more financially and your partner contributes more domestically."

If he were working and making $35k/year, would you feel this way and that it’s inequitable? 

Are you mad because things won’t be split evenly? Or mad that he planned things out so he wouldn’t have to work to maintain his lifestyle?

These are questions you need to ask yourself, and then sit down and have a larger conversation with him about what you both want out of life, because it sounds like it’s different things. 

Finally, do you have a retirement plan? Not even early, but just in general. The usual advice is to not increase your lifestyle and save extra earnings until you’re on the pathway to secure retirement. You have some math to do if you want increased lifestyle to understand how much money you’ll need to put away to continue that lifestyle when you hit retirement age (which for you may be the standard 65 or a bit older). If you don’t start saving and investing NOW, sustaining that lifestyle increase you desire gets harder over time.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Jasperoid,"I personally know a couple with the exact same situation. My own parents. Dad is FIRE while Mom is a high earner who's still working in her late fifties since she likes her job.

Since my mom is the higher earner, obviously she would want to have a better quality of life, of course not just for her but for the whole family as well. Nicer house, nicer car, etc. Dad on the other hand is much simpler, happy with his 15 year old car, no need for fancy stuff. 

Main difference is my mom is fine with being the one paying most of the household expenses. Probably because my parents are married thus willing to share everything. And the lifestyle is something she wanted, not my father.

I feel that as long as the disparity in income and lifestyle wants exists. One side of the partnership will have to pay more in order for the relationship to work out. I can't imagine asking my partner to pay more in rent just because I want to live in a bigger house when they are perfectly fine with their current simple life. I'd rather just upgrade my lifestyle together at my own expense since I am the one who wants it.

Obviously, the best solution is to talk things out and come to a compromise. I'm sure he's willing to put out more money for the household but how far he's willing to go, is something you need to find out and he needs to communicate. Obviously, it still needs to be within his means. And don't bring up that you feel like you're subsidizing him, that will just get things off the wrong foot. He might not see it that way. If I were in his shoes, I would think that you might bring in too much of a lifestyle inflation and put in my FIRE in jeopardy instead.

Either you'd have to compromise by not asking too much of him, since his income is limited compared to yours or you'd have to be okay being the one paying more in the household. I just don't see any other way for things to work out. This is how my family resolved this issue."

But also what was Mr fire paying before he moved in with you. Even in the nicer place I would imagine his 50% cost is still cheaper then living alone.

Obviously that assumes the two of you can be a team until then, but pure numbers he would be contributing a lot to your finances and you would be contributing a lot to his and retirement would be a lot more “fat”.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,apiratelooksatthirty,Look the only answer here is that you split everything. He can go back to work if he can’t afford the lifestyle y’all have together. Choosing to retire extra early doesn’t mean he gets to take advantage of you while you’re still working. I’m afraid you’re probably getting taken advantage of. Proceed with caution.
1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,gr7070,"Being unequally tethered is perfectly fine in a relationship with shared expenses, whether finances are combined or separate. 

The problem i see for you is you have no protection like a married couple does. 

Someone has to subsidize the lifestyle with uneven earnings even if much of that lifestyle is your desire - that's a compromise made with marriage/partners. 

However, with it your income you have no claim to the others assets. You're essentially giving your future (sacrificed) investments to your partner now without protection. 

That's a risk I'm unwilling to take. 

Another question, why are they only taking $35k? That's a choice, that you again are subsidizing. 

Certainly they could take more granted they'd have to work some/more hours/more years before complete FIRE. That is a choice, though, that you are (somewhat?) burdened by, and again without the risk compensated for."
1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,havenyahon,"OP, I've read through quite a bit of the comments and your replies and will try and give a perspective I haven't really seen discussed much. I think this isn't so much a finance issue as a psychological issue. You are worried you (will) resent your partner unless you get a fair split. But you're trying to work out in what way that split sounds fair to you, and your partner is resisting your attempts to do this in a clear and unambiguous manner because he doesn't want to 'financialise' your personal relationship, which is a fair way to feel.

People are getting caught up in the fact that 50/50 or 100/0 financial arrangements occur all the time between husbands and wives, and no one thinks the wife is mooching, or being subsidised, or whatever, but I think this situation is a bit different. In these relationships, usually the wife is doing all the chores, cooking, cleaning, etc, most of the looking after the kids. They're working just as hard on joint things for the relationship, or both partners are working just as hard in full time jobs and splitting the rest outside of them. This is a fair split because both partners are putting work into joint aspects of the relationship.

Your situation is different because you have partner that has saved/inherited enough money that they can get 'free money' without having to do anything. So your partner isn't putting 'just as much work' into the joint benefits of the relationship with their time. It's time they use for their own relaxation. It sounds like they're doing a few more of the chores, but not to the extent that they can be considered putting just as much work into the 'joint benefits' of the relationship as you, and this is why you feel the split is unfair.

So, when you think about increasing your financial contribution to upgrade both your lifestyles, which your partner is happy not doing, it feels unfair to you because this person doesn't seem to be working just as hard for the joint benefits of your relationship.

So if this is correct, the problem you have here is that:

1) Your partner has the right to use their money to have the 'lifestyle' they want, which it sounds like is one with a lot of free time. They shouldn't feel bad about this. If you were no longer in a relationship, and they would be living off the same amount, then this is a perfectly acceptable thing for them to want.

2) If you want an upgraded lifestyle from that, and you want them to share it with you, then you need to feel okay paying for it. You need to come to some psychology that doesn't lead to you feeling resentful due to unfairness. But...

3) You have deep feelings about what it means to 'work for the joint benefits' of your relationship and these need to be communicated to your partner so they can meet your expectations (or you need to get rid of your expectations). Otherwise you will always feel (and be correct) that they're not putting in as much work into the relationship as you are.

  
A potential way to resolution: If this person was doing work around the house, producing things for joint activities and hobbies, arranging gatherings/parties with their time, etc, would you feel better about paying more to upgrade both your lifestyles? Is your partner likely to do these kinds of things, or are they more likely to just use their time to focus on their own wants and needs? 

That may be the clincher in terms of whether the resentment builds over time. If they're not going to be putting in significant work for both of you, then you won't feel fair in devoting more of the fruits of your work, because there is no equal division of labour towards the joint goal of the relationship. You may not be able to stop yourself resenting them over time, because you'll never feel that the arrangement is 'fair' (and I think would be right), which means this isn't the relationship for you."

Not any amount anyone is going to gasp over, but I choose a charity or two I believe in and give. I also live life, doing things I enjoy today, but not doing everything I want to do, and also staying as far away from competitive purchasing (keeping up) as possible. 

But capitalism is the reason I want out. I don’t like coworkers who are backstabbing, always angling with their own agenda, seeking to get more so others have less, lying, manipulating, whatever. All of that dysfunction middle and upper management has. 

My company doesn’t have an absurd CEO to worker pay ratio. But I have been in meetings where those making very, very good money are complaining about the lowest paid who “think they need more” and how the company can’t afford it, but their bonuses are far more each year than paying those employees fifty cents or a dollar more an hour. And they aren’t giving that up, but the company survives. I’m sick of not having a voice or a say and just being a yes person who does the work for those around me to take credit. I’m tired of going into an office building everyday because the leaders are conservatives who think remote work is for lazy liberals (I could get remote work, but there are issues there as well, that’s not the point, the point is politics at work and how the people at the top have the biggest selfish and self-serving biases and they have the power - in all companies). I’m just tired of it all. It is exhausting. And the company wants more and more and more growth every year and more and more and more profit to drive growth. It’s not sustainable. 

The amount I’m trying to save is a fraction of what many here want. I don’t want a lavish life, I want a simple, peaceful, quiet life. A life where I have control of my very small corner to make it my own instead of worrying if my job will be eliminated to improve costs, or if I’ll be on a project I don’t understand that’s disorganized, ill-thought and my opinion isn’t allowed because I need to shut up and do what I’m told.

I’m tired and I’m ready to know I CAN walk away.

My goal is to be so rich, that I don’t even have to work anymore.

&gt;We all have different FIRE numbers, but for most of us it at least a million. Let’s not beat around the bush: our goal is to become—at least—millionaires. Every single one of us.

143o3y9,We’re all privileged,[deleted],"I think the context where privilege is relevant is talking about government policy, and how we assess others and their efforts. If you are advocating against development, against social safety nets etc., you need to be constantly reminded of your privilege until it sticks. If youre questioning why others cant do what you do pretty much the same.

Capitalism is not a fair system. Its not a system that cares about the welfare of its people. Succeeding is an imperative because the system is awful. That doesnt make success an accomplishment or a good. Its simply a necessicity. 

Also, charitable causes are great depending on the cause, but donating money is not a dispensation for apathy and actively fighting against economic mobility for others. You sti have an obligation to be a good person even if you write a check to wwf or whatever."

It is not privilege it is sacrifice and the children of those people are supposed to instill the same values and make the same sacrifices and teach their children the same lessons for future generations.  This exact ideology was part of the Federalist Papers.  ""Everything we hold we hold in fiduciary capacity.""  Sadly this mindset has been lost both on an individual level and a political level.  So many people just want to consume now and have no plan for their future.  They loom to the privilege argument and overlook their own shortcomings because any shortcomings are the result of the wider world not their own decisions.

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,Ok-Range6432,"You are certainly correct that you should be able to retire at roughly 50.

I think your return estimate is a little too optimistic and your withdrawal rate is a little too aggressive.  However, with compounding, this ""error"", can probably be fixed with just an extra year or three of work OR with more aggressive saving in the next 17 years.

Some questions:

1) Are you buying a house?   Will that be paid off by the time you are 49?  If you own a home you plan to stay in, your inflation rate will not be 3% on $3000/mo.  It will be more like 3% on your maintenance cost and property taxes (maybe; not if in California or elsewhere that limits property tax growth).  If your maintenance budget is $500/mo, 3% inflation over 17 years only raises this to $826/mo.  Usually this maintenance will be lower, but you'll potentially need at least 2 new roofs before you're 80 years old.  If you can do a lot of maintenance yourself, your cost/mo can be much less.  Installing solar panels is another way to reduce the effects of inflation.  Maybe consider this the next time you need to replace the roof.

2) For the daycare, how many children do you have?   If that $900/mo is literally child daycare, that will go down significantly when they are in kindergarten and even more so a few years later.  A lot of public schools will have an afterschool program for $100 - $200 per month to cover 3pm - 6pm.  If you plan for this to continue at least to high school graduation as college savings, then this extra expense will go away by the time you are 53 to 55 (assuming the youngest turns 18 when you are 49 or younger and school takes no more than 6 years).  This $900/mo doesn't needed to be included in your long-term retirement expenses.

  
Normally, FIRE calculations do not inflation adjust expenses, but instead assume 6% or 7% net market returns after inflation (so, \~9% - 10% returns before inflation).   The 4% rule is using this math.

You can also estimate your social security payment if you lookup the benefit formula, current bend points (90%, 32%, 15%), and an estimate of your average monthly earnings over 35 years (use 0s for empty years).

  
My recommendation:

Time is literally money.  Do everything you can to save as much as you can in the next few years.  If your tax bracket is 22%, save an extra $2000 per month (+$1k each) into your 401k's if you can without exceeding $23k limit.   $2000/mo x 22% will save you another $440/mo if you don't drop down into the 12% tax bracket.   Use that extra savings (and more if available) to also max $7000/yr each into Roth IRA's.  If you're healthy and can do an HSA you can save another $8200'ish into the HSA and save another 12% to 22% in taxes. 

With leftover money, keep building your emergency fund up to 6 months (before maxing 401k if you don't already have at least 3 months expenses).

If one of your companies has a mega backdoor Roth, put any extra savings there.  You can withdraw contributions in 5 years after you contribute without penalties anyway.   This can grow untouched during retirement while you draw down 401k first.

If you save hard at least for the first few years AND the market does well / average, you may even be able to retire before 49/50.

  
Even if you retire at 49 or 50, when you turn 55, get a (part?) time job with a 401k with low-fee funds.  Then rollover your old 401k and any pre-tax IRAs into that 401k.  Now you can quit that job and use the rule of 55 to withdraw w/o the 10% penalty.   Certain public safety professions can use this rule as early as 50"

Let's say you're at 1.4M at 49, investing $1600/month, you'll reach the 2,46M goal after 7 more years, at 56, which is still early retirement. At 56 you can still travel and will likely have a lot of life left in retirement, congrats! Maybe increase that monthly savings number if you can to get there sooner, but 1.43M is too low based on conventional wisdom."

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,Deep-Ebb-4139,"Lol, the calculator.net tools are too simplistic and shouldn’t be used for any serious calculations. Great plan, in theory. In practice, not so much. Everyone’s plans are idealistic. Life isn’t idealistic. It never goes as planned. There is always (always) something. Always. Often there’s many things. That’s just life. You’re correct about the LONG term and market increases, but that’s when looking at 30, 50 or even 100 year timeframes. Your plan is about 17 years. What if there’s a ‘lost decade’ at some point (fairly likely), that would instantly put your 49 target to about 60. Some suggestions seem to point towards a possible lost generation. This is just one of many things to factor in. Another would be timing, that your withdrawals may coincide with a bear period, or even a major life event or expense, which will hammer the principal more than you realise, and also reduce the base amount on which your capital is earning interest. Such things often add anything from 1-3 years, or more. Then by that time you realise that you’re really not far from retirement age anyway. A good rule of expectancy to follow is to expect the unexpected. Sure, it’s great to have a plan. But be prepared for that plan to change, at best and if you’re very lucky a fair amount, at worst an extremely large amount."

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,maythesbewithu,"Your initial plan has at least one serious flaw: using a fixed PMT calculator to compute future income does not account for how future income needs to escalate during retirement. 

Please use the right tool for the job. That payment calculator is fine for figuring out a car payment, but not for a retirement income strategy!

Example: your $8200 monthly retirement at age 50 will only feel like today's $3400 at age 70, and you will still have a decade of further declines until expected age at expiration.

Said simply, your future payments to yourself in retirement have to increase to keep pace with inflation. Retirement is a long time, so the increases over time are important to consider.

The other flaw is what many go through, a false belief that they can make in the market 2x what ""traditionally safe"" wealth extraction feels like. Anyone can make a retirement strategy look appealing when they use high returns and low inflation.

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,giftcardgirl,"I applaud your enthusiasm. Congrats on getting started early, kudos to your wife!  

However, this is not a complete plan to actually retire at 49, but it is a step in the right direction. 

You can’t count on a 9% return rate. Some years may be negative. What will you do then?

I noticed you didn’t include health insurance, which can range from $300-$500 per month per person at 49. Will you work part time for health insurance?

Do you own your home?  Your rent may outpace inflation. For you to retire with 72K/year, it’s better to have 2M. The 4% withdrawal rate is no longer safe depending on other factors like inflation, your life expectancy, etc. It’s a rule of thumb but not precise enough to apply to everyone everywhere all the time. 

I’m not sure with the calculator you’re using, but that looks to be reporting nominal amounts. 1.43M will be great to have at 49, but it won’t have the same purchasing power as it does in 2024. Your calculations appear to be based on this."

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,paq12x,"A lot of people jump on you for the higher safe withdrawal rate that they typically use but none gave you a specific example.

In June 2000, the market hit its peak then the dot-com crashed.  The market didn't return to that level until 7 years later in 2007.  Quickly after that, the financial crisis happened, and the market crashed again.  More than 6 years after the financial crisis started the market returned to the peak that it was, which is the same level back in June 2000.

That's 14 years that you don't have the 9% gain that you anticipated.  If you retired in June 2000 and continued to burn your principal for 14 years when the market stayed still,  you would be in a world of hurt.

The biggest one is healthcare, both insurance premiums and deductible.  Just that alone can eat a massive portion of an 8k a month budget when your employer is not covering the lion's share of your healthcare costs.  Our household of 4 pays $3400 a month in just healthcare premiums, and has an over $16,000 a year deductible.  Pretty easy to hit that with appendicitis and a twisted ankle.

After getting on Medicare things get smoother, but until then?   It's a massive drain on finances, our by far #1 expense per month.  Way ahead of housing, food, transportation, travel, pets etc.  About as much as all other expenses put together.

9% a year may be an achievable (if very aggressive) return.  Any return over 30 year treasury bonds is risk premium after all.  Plenty of pension funds assumed 7% returns even without factoring in inflation and are now severely underfunded."

1ffwmql,10 tips from my 20 year journey to financial freedom,ppith,"OP, 

We can relate.  The second we started focusing on investing outside of workplace retirement our accounts started growing rapidly.  We also use spreadsheets to track expenses and investments.  We started to invest more heavily in 2017 and focused more on after tax and Roth in the past few years.  I wasted a lot of my 20s with sports cars (they were fun, but they aren't investments).  We also wasted some years stock picking.  If I could go back, I would just have one sports car (instead of three plus two motorcycles) and only buy S&amp;P 500.

Our income is lower than yours as we didn't cross household income above $300K until 2022.  We save around $200K a year now.  Here are our smaller numbers:

March 2021 - NW $1M

June 2023 - $1M in investments 

August 2024 - $1.7M in investments.  Net worth $2.3M.

House paid off 2022, no debts now.  Like you, we pay cash for everything unless we can use a credit card.  We have a card with unlimited 2.625% cash back.  We used it to pay estimated taxes for safe harbor and our property taxes.  After fees, we still make a little money.  Our daughter is in kindergarten.  Wife wants to work until she's done with highschool.  We also don't flaunt jewelry, drive boring cars, though my wife loves getting some used clothes on Poshmark."

Here's the thing about taking a less stress / lower pay job.  If you're the kind of person who's used to moving up the ladder, that job won't stay low stress but it will stay low pay.  Your natural tendency will be to take on more work, more responsibility, to become that go-to person that the higher ups can rely on and... poof... you're right back to your high stress spot without the cash behind it.  

Not worth it.  Stay making the money and grinding, then get out and go your own way.

Here’s my two cents. You are going to get wrecked in any job sooner or later or always. Get paid for it or get nothing out of it.

I have seen people work weekends and to 4am and not get even 25% what big tech gives. I have seen some people on big tech literally do nothing for years, rest and vest and get 10M or more lol. 


Not all jobs are the same and most high paying jobs are demanding, because of the amount of people trying to knock you out of that position. I have seen directors get burnt and pushed out, while a regular senior that got in at the right time right place with the right rsu negations make more than a director will ever make lol


Example: getting in to meta two years ago or Nvidia and clocking in at 100 strike for the rsus. These batch of workers in any position are waiting to fully vest and are out. 

What you want to do is identify the two out of three glory hole. 

Pick two at best

1) get paid a fuck ton 
2) do something you like 
3) stress free and have lots of free time

You ll be lucky to find two out of three. Find three jackpot won’t last, reorgs will fuck you. 

There’s a 4) but you need to figure this ( health) love 

Else money can buy all three up there."
1cmt0ah,Is toxic corporate culture why most of us want to Fire? ,alexunderwater1,"Yes. Corporate culture has only gotten worse and worse. I think like many things the pandemic fast forwarded that. 

That said, I think taking a sabbatical or mini-retirement once you reach a certain number really helps to reset your mind to give less of a fuck. It also gives you hard confirmation that you have actionable f-you money.

I took a year off to travel and shake out stress and burnout — I was to the point where I was having a lot of trouble sleeping because my mind would be racing about work the next day… I couldn’t turn it off. The long time off defining how I want to live and define myself outside of work made a huge difference after going back to work. If you are able to take a step back and not work for an extended period of time you’ll see how trivial jobs actually are and aren’t really worth stressing much over.  No one who has taken a sabbatical or mini retirement has regretted it, and it’s is often regarded by those who have as a life changing event on par with the birth of a child or a marriage.

I’m now at much higher paying job with higher expectations, and at an arguably much more toxic corporation that has even more threats of layoffs, but my stress has never been lower, because I simply give less of a fuck after gaining more of a perspective. Double this with having zero debt tying you down, and you will reach peak zen."
1cmt0ah,Is toxic corporate culture why most of us want to Fire? ,possibly_dead5,"Yeah I'm a woman and a software engineer. Working in tech is a special kind of stress. Imaginary deadlines with fuzzy definitions of done and scope creep. Dealing with user complaints and top management making decisions to screw over the customers.

My dream job was actually being a secretary and I loved it while I had it. The job duties were very well defined and there wasn't a lot of pressure to do much. My job was basically to be available if someone needed me. The pay was abysmal, though. 

With tech, it feels like the job is never done. There's always more you can do and every person wants it done a different way. It feels like there's no right way to do the job. You just have to accept good enough.

Establishing and enforcing boundaries and caring a little bit less (still care about doing work I’m proud of, but if the expectations are just impossible I’ve stopped viewing my inability to meet them as a personal failure) has made a huge difference in feeling work is sustainable. I encourage you to do the best you can in an 8-9 hour workday and then stop while keeping your leadership informed of what is delayed/not getting done because of team capacity constraints. In my case it turned out fine and I went from wondering how I’d make it even one more month without snapping to feeling I can handle this for a few years until my investments have enough momentum of their own I can take a real step back (hopefully long sabbatical into lower pay/less responsibility job) without setting my timeline back very far at all."

The leaders of the U.S. are so dysfunctional we cannot pass much needed legislations and protections against the financial and geo-political crises knocking at our door. 

Financial independence allows me to stay secure in an increasingly insecure world. As climate change continues to devastate communities indiscriminately, having the financial literacy and a life absent over-consumption I can focus on the simple things in life that truly bring me purpose and happiness. 

I am mid-twenties so the idea of working a job designed to benefit a world order that might not survive the dramatic climate change that is already upon us scares me.  They say, ""be careful what you get good at"" and I don't want to get good at the job I work today. I want to get good at gardening and community development. And only in ""retirement"" can I truly workday in and day out on things I am genuinely passionate for. 

I hope to be financially independent in the next 8-10 years, and able to ""retire"" in my 40's-early 50's.

I seem to have found a firm where the corporate B.S. is less stressful than other places I have worked at. The amount of company culture frustrations that come up are not too bad.

In my current position, my manager is a super high up guy making millions a year and his manager is basically the CTO. Like many super high up guys making millions a year, they can be demanding. So now I have to manage the people in my org (with a lot of the issues folks here have discussed, including personal ones*) as well as manage up. If anyone in my org fucks up, I hear from them. If someone complains about tech, even if its a useless complaint that even Tim Cook couldn't fix, I hear from them to go ""address the issue"", and of course when tech breaks, I am ultimately responsible. 

Have stress levels gone up? Probably not! I honestly feel it is less stressful to deal with a few people issues and some operational issues than get yelled at by traders losing money when their tech isn't working - but that's a terrible bar to start with. However, *quick wins have gone down* which is something I miss from my days being an individual tech contributor with a support rotation.

**I guess my TL;DR is: if you are good with people and you have a decent company culture, climbing up to management isn't so bad, but it's still a job with annoyances and ultimately I'd rather not work.**

So why should a job be so stressful?

But of course I suspect many of us are card carrying overachievers or naturally insecure Re: money and the psychological pain of criticism or failing keeps us from feeling secure in our leverage.

In the end you have to find what's sustainable. If you're making enough to fire by 2031 but burn out well before then, that won't do you any good!

I think it's also important to keep in mind that there is also an opportunity cost to FIREing later. For one, as you age, you will naturally have less energy and drive to pursue and be challenged by new endeavors. Also, at some point one can also become pretty institutionalized to the corporate world, making it harder to find meaning beyond it, which is why so many retirees actually go back to work."

It's because I cannot actually get a job with the work life balance I desire. I would like to work Tues-Thurs, 9a to 2pm. Unfortunately, I cannot feed and house myself off such low income, and health insurance is tied to full time employment. RE desire is to allow me to work the volume I want to.

Corporate culture isnt really the source of the stress for me. It's that the work is hard, and that there is so many hours of it.

Both stress and income were monotonically related to how many people I was managing (income was maybe the logarithm of how many people I was managing).

Yes, it gets more toxic the higher you go. Some companies probably have a more healthy culture than mine, but I think the issue was that people who want more money are more ambitious, and so the people at the top tend to be (not always, but tend to be) those who are more self-interested and focused on money.  Occasionally they're old-timers who are there because they rode the wave even though there are more qualified people. It's difficult and very competitive to get promoted to the very top, and you tend to see competitive people up there, which is why it's toxic.

I generally suspect that the best managers are probably people who only reluctantly become managers.

Anyways, my advice would probably be to stick it out for a few more years as a manager but consider switching back to IC for a bit.  Being IC is a lower-stress role, certainly, and you'll last longer.

For example: retiring 7 years fully-burnt out doesn't seem as good as what might make you happier if you *could* retire in 11 years but decide to work for 15 years instead, because you love the work you're doing."

I will probably continue to work full time past that date because I love the work that I do.

Retiring for most people will be leaving your job at your highest earning potential. It is a fate everyone will need to move on from. Giving up all you worked for.

Why stop at 60-65? Why not go to 67-72, hell at 75 think about how even MORE richer you will be..

These issues above will have you like most people, which is working long past you need to and potentially having regrets.

The fire movement is a shift of the above focus. You will have to practice this.

Right now you see FIRE as LEAVING your job. Which is why you are like its not so bad if I stay Ill be mega rich! You should be seeing FIRE as something to run TOWARDS to. Something to look forward to, having a plan of why you want to retire.

Otherwise you will be stuck in 1 more year in perpetuity. The same argument you are making now you can make until you die. Think of the reasons why you wont retire at 80 years old. And apply it age 70, 60, 50.


*Tldr: fire isnt about hitting a number, its about living a different life. If you only focus on the first part you will lose what FIRE is.*"

-20s:  invincible, social life maximized

-30s:  some minor body wear and tear accumulates, but otherwise still near invincible.  Social life begins to slow as people become more focused on family vs friends

-40s:  'middle age' start to appear and fitness no longer peak, but still fully functional.  Social life is relatively low.  Stress from starting to peak.

-50s:   full blown 'middle age', ache/pains more problematic.  Serious illnesses begin to appear.

-60s:  health starting to decline, but still fully independent and still do anything except maybe more extreme aspects of sports.  Serious illness becomes more common, especially in those who don't take care of themselves.  Social lives pick up again as kids leave the next.  Vacations/activities are now affordable and accessible; can't do quite as crazy stuff as when younger, but still can live the good life.

-70s:  I often see the 70s as the last good decade.  Health is declining and joint replacements /etc are common.  People are finally retired going on the vacations they always dreamed of, though they don't do as much as and starting to lose independence.  So vacations/activities become tame.  Death starts to become less uncommon at this age.

-80s:  Major health decline is common.  Major loss of independence.  Mixed bag on whether life is still 'good'.  Death is common.

-90s:   If you've made it to this point, you are a mix of lucky and took care of yourself.  Significant loss of independence.  Quality of life is typically not great.

  
The reality of life can be sobering.  Take advantage of the time you've got.  Be a good person and help people.  Don't perpetuate things that make life shitty for other people and next generations.

  
So, what is that huge pile of money really going to buy you, if you already have basics needs covered?  Then ask the question again if you are somewhere in the decline phase of life."

For me, for example, the jump in quality of life between $1 MM and $2 MM would be far higher than the jump between $2 MM and $3 MM, which in turn would be higher than the jump between $3 MM vs $4 MM.  The marginal QoL improvement at each dollar amount will look different for everyone, but the general rule is going to hold true.  That is, while you might have a shit ton more money if you kept working until 65 vs. 58, would all that extra money actually be hugely useful to you or even your kids?

Regarding your kids, I will probably inherit a significant amount of money from my parents when they die, but it's not very important to me personally.  I want to retire early, but I also want to earn that wealth, and I also want my parents to spend their hard-earned money on things that bring them happiness, enjoyment, and comfort in their old age.

2. Traditional employment necessitates trading time for money
3. Time is finite.  The diminishing marginal returns thing doesn't really apply to things that are finite, or at least it doesn't apply in the same way.  If time does have a point of diminishing marginal return, I have not personally ever experienced it.
4. Quality of life diminishes with age.  There are things you can do at 40 that you will not be able to do at 65.
5. Kids are only young once.  You get one shot to spend time with them.  When you are 65, they will no longer be kids.  Leaving them a bunch of money when you are dead is not going to bring back the time you didn't spend with them when they were young.
6. Generational wealth is generally squandered by about the third generation.  This coincides with all sorts of other problems (addictions etc.) that come alongside unearned wealth.

Choose carefully.

I'm 43 and haven't worked in 2 1/2 years.  My kid is 6 (single dad, have him 50% of the time).  Yes, my net worth at death could be multiple times higher had I continued working until 65.  I had a high paying job so I still have enough money to have a pretty solid quality of life, definitely not a meager existence but also nowhere near as luxurious as it could be if I worked and spent most of my income like most people.  IME, unless you get caught up in the chasing status hamster wheel, in which case no amount of money will ever be enough, you'll eventually get to a level of spending where it's like ""this is good enough, I'd rather have more time than more spending money at this point""."

You either work, or you're retired. But it doesn't have to be like that if you don't want to. When you've hit your first goal around 50, you can take it easier. Still work, but take more (unpaid) time off. Change to different job that is less stress and less hours. Or keep the job and income you have, put all your earned income in stocks and start living off 4% each year. Then the next year you do the same, and the next. As you still keep pouring money into your portfolio, and hopefully you'll get great returns as well, you'll start to get to a point where your income has reached a point where more money doesn't really change anything in your lives. That's when you quit working alltogether.

Looking at my own spreadsheet, at about 43 I can realistically retire. But at 67, I could retire with 10x that amount to spend. Right now I'm actually taking my withdrawel rate, live off of that and add all work income to the portfolio. Then next year, take 4% off an increased portfolio and live off of that. Then over the years I can work less (already doing that), have a bigger income, and at some point I might stop working all together if the income from my portfolio far outweighs my work income.

1c82w4y,The cliff is steep: How do you choose to retire early when working 5 more years can bring so much more,jlcnuke1,"I **can** retire now. That gives me around $60k/year spend plus enough to afford the sailboat I want to buy myself for retirement. As a 47m, that's plenty for me. My retirement home (currently housing my dad for his retirement, I bought it for him and my mom when they couldn't work anymore and the plan is I'll retire there someday as well) will be paid off in 3 years (2.5% interest rate, not interested in trying to pay it down early and losing the PI payment amounts would be a nice buffer on my expenses if we have a bad sequence of returns at the start of my retirement.

You'll note I didn't say I **am** retired though. That's simply because my work situation for this year ended up being 95% amazing, low effort and low time, and only 5% typical work stress and headaches.

Now, if I waited until I was 54, I'd probably be able to spend $100k+ per year instead. That's a lot of extra charity, ability to help family, more luxuries, and pretty much not having to pay attention to what I spend at all for me (mcol area, low mortgage, car paid off in August).

If I waited until I was 60, geez, I'd probably have $160k+ available to spend, more than I ever made in a year in my life.

So, why am I retiring before my birthday next year?

Simply the things I want to do in retirement, scuba dive, sail around the world, travel, hike, see new cultures and experience them and what they have to offer can be done comfortably for what I have, so why spend another 5, 10, 15 years doing a job I don't care for, for people I don't really care for or respect, simply to have more money that I don't need?

I also have diabetes, and thanks to stress for a number of years drank too much, so my life expectancy and anticipated health in later years isn't great, so the idea of waiting another 10-15 years to try and do what I want sounds like a recipe to come here and post:  
""I waited to long to retire and now I don't have the health needed to do what I wanted to do in retirement so I sit at home or go to doctor's appointments these days instead"".  That's the reality for a lot of people in their 60's, honestly. My mom's health got too bad to work before she hit full retirement age, and most of her retirement ended up spent barely able to walk before she couldn't even manage that anymore.

If you have something to ""retire to"", then sticking around for more money you don't need really needs some kind of incentive. Mine happens to be a lot of free time to do things preparing for my retirement (language learning, learning to play guitar, research on the boats I may buy, etc.) while still having lots of free time for my hobbies and enjoyment (I get over 8 weeks vacation per year, so this year includes diving in the Galapagos, cave diving in Mexico, a week in the Bahamas with friends, scuba diving in Roatan Honduras, and a few weeks I haven't bothered planning anything yet. Plus a number of concerts, trip with friends to celebrate some of them turning 50 in Vegas, etc.

So this year is 85% retirement already, while they still pay me full time, so sticking around for a year of prep seemed reasonable. I wouldn't do it for a second year unless the market just tanks between now and then though."

Say you max out your 40-k’s at $46k for a couple and you have $1 MM. At 10% growth it grows $100k so your contribution is 31.5%. Once it doubles 6-7 years later your contribution is now 19%. And if you just stop contributing completely it only adds on 2-4 years. This is far different from making retirement contributions in your 20’s when 90%+ of the growth is your contributions.

But…I’m having second thoughts about Fire or even Barista Fire.

A second solution: Work in your current org till 53, and then switch to a lower intensity, lesser pay job (e.g. 30 hours a week at 30 percent pay cut) - which you can happily do till 70, while having sufficient time for yourself."

As your NW builds, the reality of your wealth will start to paint a nice, then wealthy, then rich picture of a sustainable life.

However, I intend to fire before our house is paid off so I've started basing my number off of my annual expenses + tax + estimated remaining mortgage when I fire.

For example, since I have a \~$2k/month mortgage payment at 2.75%, I'm not in a big hurry to pay it off early. So if I expect to have $150k left on the mortgage when I FI, and let's say my annual spend plus taxes is $100k right now (including the mortgage payments), I can consider my fire number as:

30 x (100k - (12 \* 2k))) + 150k = 2,430,000

Which is **30x** (**total current spend** \- **annual mortgage cost**) + **remaining mortgage balance at FIRE**. So that number would be **2.43mil**, and would account however I want to handle the mortgage - either a lump sum payoff or hold onto it - when I FIRE. 

One could argue that you could do the same math at 25x instead of 30x and still be using somewhat conservative numbers, since that extra 150k will have time to grow and will likely springboard you to additional returns if you don't use the lump sum 150k to payoff the mortgage upon FIRE. That math would work out to **2.05mil**, so it's significantly lower. 

Not sure if that helps you, but that's how I think of things. Unfortunately, I'm a long enough way off that I won't have to worry about the exact number for some time though lol"

Equalling 2.1M total?  70k expenses per year are your expenses or your household?  Or you're saying 70k for your portion?

I like all your numbers and your attitude about things.  I think you got it figured out.  Sounds like your plan then is to probably burn down your cash/investments until the IRAs kick in 12 years right?  1M today will probably be at least 3M by then, so burning it down would be a-ok.  3M at age 59 plus your SS when it kicks in, even if it isn't much, would give you more than enough money.

The only thing that would keep me up at night is relying on my wife's job for health coverage.  I'd want to develop a plan B.  Jobs get lost all the time, and in a very real way you're still relying on that middle class job to put the ends together.  I guess like you said you have WA state 100% coverage provided you keep the expenses low, so that might put you in a box at age 60 if you wanted to spend more but can't, maybe this is a nonissue.

One thing:  Are you factoring in the depreciating value of your SS payments in 15 years?  What you are set to earn is based on where you're at today with an assumption that you'll keep working.  I do believe the lack of work between now and then will mean some depreciation on the payout, there's a site for calculating that, I forget which."

1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,ericdavis1240214,"The best generational inheritance you can give your kids is to be present for them when they are young. Travel with them. Give them amazing experiences. Support them in their education and their interests. Teach them to be happy, successful people.

At the FRE number you are talking about, you will almost certainly also be able to leave your child or children a meaningful financial inheritance as well. Not to mention helping them along the way with things like college, a first car, a down payment on a first house… the sort of things that give a kid a real head start in life.

You will also be young enough that during their school years, when there will be several months a year when it's not practical to be taking long trips, and when they will be busy with other things during the day, you may choose to do some other kind of lower key work. The kind of work that let you continue to be really present for your kids, but that could also slow your retirement burn rate and help your portfolio grow more than you are probably currently projecting.

1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,LittleBigHorn22,"Honestly probably won't get a ton of people in here going for the generational wealth. FIRE is about getting your own time back not providing time for future generations.

If generational wealth is important to you, keep in mind that very few people make good decisions when handed huge amount of money when they never had to work.

If you make enough that your kids don't work and then give them all the money when you die, they might blow it all. And at that point what did it do? 

I would say retire early and spend it with your kids. You don't need to be fully retired or to die with zero, but don't need to give them money so they retire at age 0."

1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,wiley321,"Pretty similar circumstances, actually. We initially planned to fire this year with around 2.5 mil and slow travel for a few years. We hadn’t accounted for our child being really happy in school and enjoying our community as much as we are. It felt a bit selfish to uproot her life for our enjoyment.

We decided to start our business last year and are making enough to get us to the numbers you described. In 14 years, when our child is off to school, we can decide to slow travel or whatever our hearts desire in our early/ mid 40s. Until then, we are planning 6-8 weeks of travel a year, and splurging on the things that we enjoy on a daily basis.

I have learned that, in this capacity, I actually love to work. While I only work 20-25 hours a week, it gives me a lot of fulfillment and I enjoy spending time with my employees/ patients."

We all (3 siblings) beg them to spend their money on things that make them happy in their golden years. I don't want a thing from them but memories, time, and love. My own wealth will take care of itself."
1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,AotKT,"I'm the child of parents who grew up poor but worked hard and got lucky with some unintentional market timing and will likely be leaving me and my sister each a couple million, which won't really affect either of our lives' significantly by the time my parents pass because we're both on track for FIRE too. My sister is 10 years younger and grew up with tropical vacations whereas I had camping. She got brand name stuff, I got library books. She is NOT spoiled because my parents made education a top priority, insisted on both of us doing chores and getting small jobs if we wanted spending money as teenagers (I babysat, she babysat and worked at an ice cream shop) and also we were pre-helicopter era so we both had to become really independent.

Where the wealth has come in handy for generations is in targeted spending on the kids. I put myself through most of college when I could go part time and work full time in ye olden days when that was possible, but my parents paid for the last 4 quarters that required me to go full time so I had zero college debt. They put my sister into an amazing secular private school growing up that I had qualified for but even with some scholarships my parents still couldn't afford; the quality of her education was amazing and directly led to her going to a top university for undergrad and an even better one for law school. One time I moved back home for 3 months in between apartment leases so I didn't have to pay the exorbitant month to month rent. My husband and I paid for our own small, simple wedding so my parents bought our honeymoon and all we had to pay was our incidental expenses and the upgrade to business class from coach. When my husband and I bought our first home, my parents gave me a substantial down payment gift with written proof that the gift was just for me. When we sold our home years later, that equity came back to me, which was a nice bump to my post-divorce finances. In between all that are small things like paying for a flight for me to visit or a family vacation somewhere nice. I can afford that but I wouldn't visit as often if I had to pay each time.

In other words, the amount you need to spend to make a huge impact in your kids' lives is really negligible compared to what you think: enough to keep them out of (smart) debt, to open doors to opportunities for career advancement and life joy, and to create experiences of shared time together.

Personally in your situation, I'd quit when your wife goes on maternity leave and use the time to spend with your kids. When the kids are in school, one or both of you can always go back to work. Even if you make significantly less because of the gap in your work history, it's still going to help pad the financial security."
1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,TrashPanda_924,"I struggle with this. The US is in structural decline in my opinion and I’m terrified of the world my teenage kids will inherit. Do I work until I die so they’ll have more resources? Do I retire early according to plan and ride off into the sunset with my sizable, but not generational, portfolio? This is something that becomes more real, daily, as I creep closer to retirement."
1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,JarvisL1859,"It looks to me like you all are in great shape and this might not be such a binary choice. Even if you FIRE soon, assuming you have a reasonably moderate safe withdrawal rate a lot of the assets will be left over for your kids to inherit. Also, you could push it back a few years instead of an entire decade. Overall I would encourage you to think more in terms of a spectrum than a binary here.

Ultimately it’s really more a question of how much— how much longer you work, how much you withdraw annually, how much you want to leave behind. I would just do some simple modeling with FIRE calculators to answer these questions.

Still, I would be tempted to keep working if you all are happy in your careers. I think hitting escape velocity is very tempting and that would give you increased flexibility in retirement, almost fat FIRE, as well as the possibility of leaving a lot behind. Especially if you are going to have a normalish life where you stay in one place and are not nomadic once you have kids. But on the other hand I have heard that people sometimes want to FIRE when they do have kids because they want to spend more time with the kids so that might be your experience too idk

You prioritize money too much. Once you have kids, you should focus on them more than just making more money. You’ll help them so much more in life by being good parents and being present and supportive over giving them more money. You don’t teach them work ethic by working a job they don’t see you at and you’re not a good role model by showing them you should spend your time trying to make more money than you’ll ever need instead of spending your time with your kids and the people you care about.

I look at this issue from the perspective of being my parents' child since I'm not yet married nor do I have children.

Assuming a reasonable low-cost Boglehead-type portfolio of ETFs, perhaps 4-6% might be a more reasonable assumption? (I have no crystal ball and wish everyone could get 9%; I just wouldn’t plan my life based on that assumption.)

Also, if you FIRE in your mid-thirties, you will need to have enough to support yourselves for 50 or more years. That budget will need to include medical expenses and live-in helper costs in the event you get sick.

I suggest that you work out what your annual spending will look like when you FIRE, including education costs for your future children. Most likely you will want them to go to good private schools and then good universities, all of which is expensive. Best to estimate on the high side, all told.

Then, set your FIRE figure based on a 3% withdrawal rate to be conservative, given your probably long remaining lives and your likely future wish to leave behind money for your children (which may strengthen after you actually have children).

Don’t forget to factor in taxes on your investments.

I have a hunch that on the kind of conservative assumptions I outlined above, 5M may not be safe to FIRE on in one’s mid thirties, with a couple of kids coming.

Generational wealth is important to me and additionally I can’t imagine retiring until my kids are at least in high school. The things I want to do once I retire would make for an unstable childhood: living abroad, spending weeks at a time road-tripping in our van ect.. so I don’t really want to retire, and leave all that money on the table just to hang out around the house while my kids are at school. I also want to set a good example for my kids as you’ve mentioned in the comments. That said my career ambition took a nosedive after my son was born. 

If all goes according to plan there is a point at which my investment returns will be substantially more than my salary contributions and it will no longer make much of a difference to continue making contributions to my retirement. For me this occurs when I reach 8-10M NW in my 40s. Most of my money is tied up in retirement accounts, so I’ll have to coast fire or barista fire after that. Maybe work seasonally, and start venturing into retirement while still maintaining a stable lifestyle for my kids.

By the time my son was 6 he had traveled though the US a fair amount. He had been to Canada 2 times, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Spain. Additionally we Rved from the southern US into Baja spent 2 months driving the pensila and then 4 months between AZ, MT and ID (during covid times).

Buying a ticket simply confronts you with the sudden possibility of acchieving financial freedom TODAY versus investing for many years until you can FIRE somewhere in the future.  It's not about how big that chance actually is. Buying a ticket might make you think more deeply and more concrete about the reasons why you actually want to FIRE and that might even increase your motivation because buying that ticket might force you to define what's really important for you.

But I also like the authors more general approach: Buy the ticket, start daydreaming what you would do and what you would change IF you win, BUT THEN actively starting to move your life in that direction even without winning. That could mean ramping up your savings rate but it could also be anything else, it's about getting motivated to actively improve your life in whatever way you desire.

We should get there in around 11 more years, which lines up with when our house will be paid off (refinanced into a 15-year mortgage back in 2020 at 1.999% rate). I'll be around 45. I could delay until the kid goes off the college, so that would delay it a few years, but this is our rough plan.

100% equities. I plan on having 2 years of cash reserves,  but right now, I don't consider my cash as part of my fire number as it is just my emergency fund.

At the time of fire, I would likely have about 6% cash and everything else in equities. The cash would be on top of the 3.3 million portfolio.

The 100K spend is above our minium threshold. Actual expenses I think around 45K-55k (assuming no travel), but we are looking to get into ChubbyFIRE and have the extra float for activities and travel.

Lowering our spending for a year or two would allow for the 200K cash to go as far as 3-4 years - and that assumes we are still eating out as much as we do now. With more time cooking food, we could drop it even more.

We have a lot of safety nets that would be in place. The ultimate goal is that when we pull the trigger and FIRE that we wouldn't HAVE TO go back to work, if we decide to work part time or whatever for work we enjoy that would be fine. We don't want to be put in a situation where we are having to go back to work, likely at a much lower overall rate just to avoid digging too deep into our portfolio.

1fgq5s0,How are you modeling the potential for senior care in your FIRE number?,Zphr,"Memory care in many places currently runs between $70K/yr and $120K/yr, depending mostly on the quality of the facility and accomodation choice.  It's not cheap, but also not that pricey considering the price includes most living expenses.  Fundamentally it's just another variant of LTC, but it's definitely not normally hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.

LTC, including memory care, is always a wild card and can be rather expensive. Indeed, it's so costly that even the LTC insurance market can't properly price and actuarially model for it with great accuracy, hence the persistent decrease in benefits and increases in premiums relative to payouts we have seen as the LTCI industry has matured.

A large HSA is perhaps the best LTC mitigation strategy there is after simply being wealthy enough to not care about such costs. The fact that one of life's largest costs can be paid for with triple or quadruple (if you got the FICA break too) tax-advantaged dollars is a huge win.

We have a sizable HSA that will provide us with ample tax-advantaged funding for LTC. We will also evaluate available LTCI options when we get closer, but I'm not hopeful there will be anything worth buying.

If we happen to run through our HSA, then we have our primary portfolio to lean on as well as each other and four loving kids who all seem likely to become responsible, financially successful adults.

If all of that fails to be sufficient, then there's really nothing else that could reasonably be done other than working several extra years purely to derisk a low probability scenario.  I don't see any plausible scenario where we would ever need to or be able to use Medicaid.

Also, unless you buy into a secured contract with a high-end facility that will allow Medicaid transition upon asset depletion, then most LTC places that take Medicaid alone are not anywhere you would usually ever want to be."

1fgq5s0,How are you modeling the potential for senior care in your FIRE number?,alanonymous_,"Two thoughts:

1) I’ll hopefully be of sound mind as I get closer to the age where I need to be concerned about dementia and elder care and can set up myself (or my family) at that time. Creating trusts, divesting myself, etc.

2) If I truly have dementia, I’m not sure I’ll actually care about my net worth, or anything else for that matter. It’s a very serious, debilitating, and sad disease. I’ll have hopefully set myself up via trusts prior to this so that I don’t go through all the money I had and can leave some to others. However, if I _do_ go through all the money I have, I doubt I’ll be of mind to even know. I just hope I’m nice and care for those around me during that time (rather than hateful &amp; paranoid that tends to come with the disease), should I ever be in that position.

So, to answer this - I’m very much wanting to be set up in wealth by 80 and ongoing. However, after 90, well, here’s hoping. (All FIRE scenarios though for myself / me and my partner have us with a significant net worth by the time we’re 95, so I’m not too too concerned.

Mainly, it is cheaper for her, income for us and she receives better care from me than she would at a facility ( considering her current level of functioning and relative health stability). We believe this provides her with the best “retirement” she could hope for given her disabilities because she spends every day with her young grandkids, goes out to lunch with friends or goes for shopping and manicures with her sister. This arrangement also enables us to preserve her estate, basically only spending the interest it earns, so we have money to care for her well at the end of her life and possibly some inheritance, though this is a secondary concern.

c. Pray for in-community Medicaid being enough full time care.  This will end when one abled skilled person at a time is not physically enough to care for you.

d.  Combined with option A, sell primary home so that equity can be used in addition to SWR.  This is challenging when a spouse is alive unless downsizing releases enough equity.

Honestly, I don't think that they will ever get ahead of it if you would have considered growth potential on the money they invested.   Dad is at that point, where on his next audit, they may decide to not cover him.   That's not going to be a good day.   He won't go to assisted living because of the reasons the OP states.   If he's not going to get full care, and he still has to pay a premium, he's going to go home.   That's just the way he is.   His mind is 100%.

I've looked into buying LTC for my wife and myself, ages 56 and 55.   It only works out if you collect very early.   Otherwise, if you have the money, you are better off having it invested.   We're going to roll the dice.

Good post OP."

181hlrt,Long Term Care - How it works IRL,highport2020,Most LTC policies are hybrid now and linked to life insurance. Not only does the premium never go up but very straight forward in claims. If you have nest egg over 500k its the biggest risk. I am about to buy it myself

With TransAmerica, I think.  They are only in their 70’s and haven’t needed to use it yet, so I can’t speak to any “gotchas” that might be in their plan.  But it is supposed to max out at up to $380 per day.  If it only covered $40-80 a day like you mentioned, self-insuring might have made more sense."

181hlrt,Long Term Care - How it works IRL,cballowe,This sounds like specifically a long term care policy where you're paying an annual premium for some daily benefits? How does this compare to something like a single premium life insurance policy with a long term care rider?

181hlrt,Long Term Care - How it works IRL,pooplouge,The best way that I’ve seen this tackled nowadays is through Life insurance with a long term care rider attached.

That was a very insightful write up that even those of us in the business do not get firsthand practical feedback on and commend you for spending the time to document your experience. What we’re selling most these days are hybrid Life / LTC policies — Lincoln and Nationwide have two of the better products.  The policy limit can either be spent down during your lifetime if you qualify for long term care benefits or paid to a beneficiary upon the insured’s passing.

The policies today are much better, and are codified and regulated by IRC 7702(b). The policy you bought wasn't written to your advantage.  This is why the Internal Revenue Code regulated tax qualified long term care insurance 25 years ago.  The policies today do not have different benefits or clauses for different settings.  Waiver of Premium applies to receiving benefits in any setting. You receive 100% of your monthly benefit amount in all settings: home care, adult day care, assisted living or nursing home. There are no maximum number number of days in a policy today. Policies are pool of money based not time based. You receive either a maximum amount of money, or Unlimited amount of money.  Medicare days do not count against any benefits with today's policies.  Hospital stays do not count against any benefits.  You are either receiving money from the insurance company which reduces your lifetime maximum benefits, or you are not receiving money.  Many policies today are also cash indemnity policies that do not require any receipts for reimbursement."

How much risk are you willing to accept (of either running out of money or of working longer than you had to)? What income and resources are available to you?

My wife and I retired at 47 and 45, respectively, and we didn't do anything optimally. We saved a bunch of money and (usually) maxed out our 401k's but other than that we were way ""suboptimal"". We were underinvested in non-qualified accounts for early retirement; my wife celebrated paying off her student loans by leasing an Audi A4 Quattro; we spent money on travel and other experiences (including scuba diving and private pilot lessons). My wife kept a bunch of money in some ridiculous energy sector mutual fund at Edward Jones for 10 years because the advisor was an ex-colleague of hers from an old job.

",TraditionalKale6025,"It's great you're thinking about FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) and exploring different investment strategies! There's indeed a lot of information out there, and what works best depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and FIRE goals. 
Let's break down the two strategies you mentioned and discuss their pros and cons:
**Strategy A: High Risk Early, Transitioning to Conservative**
**Pros:**
* **Potential for Higher Returns:** Historically, equities have outperformed bonds over the long term. Starting with a 100% equity allocation in your 20s allows you to maximize exposure to this potential growth during a time when you have a longer time horizon to recover from market downturns.
* **Time for Recovery:** Younger investors have more time to recover from market fluctuations, making a higher risk tolerance potentially more suitable.
**Cons:**
* **Volatility and Emotional Impact:** 100% equity portfolios can be highly volatile. Experiencing significant market downturns early in your investing journey might lead to emotional decisions (like selling low) that could harm your long-term returns.
* **Sequence of Returns Risk:** As you approach retirement, experiencing a significant market downturn could severely impact your withdrawal strategy and require you to delay retirement.
**Strategy B: Building a Yield Base, Then Shifting Aggressive**
**Pros:**
* **Income Generation and Compounding:** Focusing on yield-bearing assets early on provides a steady stream of income that can be reinvested, potentially leading to significant compounding over time.
* **Psychological Comfort:** Some individuals find the stability of income-generating investments more comforting, especially in the early stages of their FIRE journey.
**Cons:**
* **Lower Growth Potential:** Yield-bearing assets typically offer lower returns than equities, potentially slowing down your path to FIRE, especially in a low-interest-rate environment.
* **Inflation Risk:** If the yield generated doesn't outpace inflation, your purchasing power could erode over time.
**Finding the Right Balance**
Instead of viewing these as two completely separate strategies, consider a more balanced approach:
* **Age-Based Allocation:** A common approach is to use a target-date fund or a similar strategy that automatically adjusts your asset allocation based on your age. These strategies typically start with a higher equity allocation and gradually shift towards bonds as you get closer to retirement.
* **Risk Tolerance and Goal Setting:** Honestly assess your risk tolerance. How comfortable are you with market fluctuations? Define your FIRE goals clearly. What are your desired retirement age and income needs?
* **Diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes (equities, bonds, real estate, etc.), sectors, and geographies to manage risk.
* **Regular Review and Adjustment:** Your financial situation and goals will evolve. Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your strategy as needed.
**Remember:**
* **FIRE is a Marathon, Not a Sprint:** Building wealth takes time and discipline. Focus on consistent investing and making informed decisions.
* **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor who can help you create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances and goals.
Ultimately, the ""best"" strategy is the one that aligns with your individual risk tolerance and financial goals and allows you to sleep well at night knowing you're on track towards achieving FIRE. "

It makes sense in the individual communities devoted to each since those are lifestyle-based and have some limited specific financial concerns, but elsewhere it's all just FIRE or not.

If someone is at their chosen SWR, then they've reached FIRE.  If not, then not.  Nobody other than them cares if their preferred annual spend is $60K or $600K.

To the extent people want a measurement yardstick, the FIRE metric for measuring actual progress is withdrawal rate, not withdrawal amount.  Someone spending $300K a year at 5% is a hell of a lot less securely FIRE'd than someone spending $150K a year at 2%.  Even the dollar figures don't tell you much about actual lifestyle since the $300K budget could be significantly less luxurious in a VHCOL than the $150K budget is in a MCOL.

LeanFIRE is the only one that is meaningfully unique because that community focuses on frugality/minimalism, plus being low on the AGI scale dramatically ups the yield from the government via things like the tax code, ACA, and FAFSA."

Using the FatFIRE (90-percentile) definition you provided, that would correspond to $8,924/month spending, or an annual $107,088. This is much lower than $216,056.

I'm ignoring things like taxes, but even accounting for that, the expense would still be much lower than $216,056."
1d1ukv2,"Defining LeanFIRE, FIRE, ChubbyFIRE, FatFIRE (2024 edition)",JoeFas,"The problem with using population percentiles as a metric for each FIRE level is that they don't take into account one's marital status and local cost of living. I've always defined leanFIRE as having the bare minimum you need to retire based on your SWR. Standard and Chubby FIRE are pretty much the same thing to me, and I define that as having at least twice your leanFIRE amount. That should give you enough cushion to survive a major downturn."

One key missing point is that as a married couple filing jointly, you can pull up to about $125K in gains with no fed tax. Since not everything you pull will be gains, you may be pulling close to $150K annually with no fed tax.

Therefore, add at least a 20% premium to FIRE income vs salary equivalents. $150K a year from my investments is likely at least $180K a year in salary equivalent."

These numbers assume the 4% Rule, but that’s a forecasting rule, not a prediction of what will actually happen in retirement. In reality, you’ll almost certainly have much more to spend than the 4% rule suggests.

For example, someone with $1.85M in investable assets should assume a conservative 74k for planning purposes. But in actual reality, they will (on average) earn roughly double that, putting them firmly in the ChubbyFIRE spending range.

This is generally true across the spectrum. If you save enough to guarantee a 4% SWR at one level, the chances are good that you’ll actually have enough to live at the next higher level."

Investment income is not taxed for Social Security and Medicare like wage income is so, for example, you don't need $74,202 in FIRE income to match a worker in the middle bracket. Rather, you would need about $69k. Also relevant to note that income on a Roth IRA is never taxed so if most of your retirement assets are in a Roth you would need to draw only about $59.4k, for the years after 59.5, to have an equivalent amount of after tax spending money. For after tax funds too it will be taxed as capital gains, not regular income, so the comparison becomes a bit more complex. There are loopholes to minimize taxes on capital gains such as running winners and selling losers and, also, keeping your income low enough to get the 0% rate on most of them."

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",Earth2Andy,"I’m in that exact position and just wrote about it as a comment in r/chubbyFire.

Here’s how I’m approaching it….

I did a pretty exhaustive budget of what I thought my post retirement budget would look like.  Including amortizing all those once a decade expenses a lot of people forget.

Once I had a baseline budget and an SWR I was comfortable with, I started to say ‘what would I change if I had $500k more?’  So it was things like, we’d spend X more per year on travel, or we’d drive  nicer cars and up our entertainment budget by X.

I did this in $500k increments from about $2M to $5M.

Then I looked at how many extra years I thought it would take me to get from one to the other.  Is it worth working 2 extra years to add $20k per year to our travel budget and have a cleaner once a month?  Hell yes!!  Is it worth 6 extra years for a bigger house with a pool and a yard service, probably not to me.

That exercise really helped me narrow down where I started seeing diminishing returns in keeping working longer.

It’s not lost on me that the exercise spat out 3-4 more years.  And I’m wondering if it will always look like it’s worth 2 more years? But I don’t think so.  I did this about a year ago and it still looks about the same that 3-4 is down to 2-3 now."

I'm 39 with a NW of $4.3M ($3.6M liquid) and when I was 25 I estimated my fire number between $1 and $2 million. I allowed my lifestyle to inflate in part because I managed to start making an income way higher than I ever anticipated, and as much as it brings me shame to say this (as I'd rather have more going on outside of work) I'm at a point where I enjoy more things about my job than not.

My pay is still a large chunk of my net worth so every year or two I work I am significantly increasing either the level of luxury I'll have when I retire, or, the amount I'll be able to give to charities and loved ones. 

I try to remember it's work to live and not live to work. I'm pretty confident I'll be done either when I hit $5M NW or just before turning 41 (just for the goal of ""retire at 40"") but if I suddenly like my job a lot less, I won't hesitate to quit and be done sooner."

You will be basically stuck on a fixed income of something about $65k per year. That might be comfortable now, but will it be comfortable a quarter century from now?

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",jerolyoleo,"If your number is based on say a 4% WR and you’re FIREing at an all time market high, then OMY potentially adds a lot of safety margin. If you dream of a $100k spend and your SWR only yields $65k, then maybe an extra year or two would make sense. But if you’re already being conservative and you are good with that spend, well, life is short."

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",firey-wfo,"I set-up an excel spreadsheet to model current spending from income vs RE income from assets. There is a diminishing return on additional investments. 

I plan to increase spending every year and decrease annual savings until I say, “thats’s it I can’t spend this much without absurd spending, or I tire of work.” Keep annual spending at or below the “potential RE spending."

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",OriginalCompetitive,"This can be a hard question, but not at the numbers you posit. A NW of $2M is honestly not that much compared to a net income of $300k. At 4%, it’s just $80k—which is still a fair amount, don’t get me wrong, but there’s a meaningful difference between $80k and $160k, for example, and genuinely tough question whether that extra money might really improve your life. On the other hand, the difference between $160k and $240k (to me) is much more marginal."

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",ericdavis1240214,"On the plus side, you win every year you work because you save more money and that money needs to cover one less year of retirement.  

On the minus side, you lose every year because you get one less year of retirement.  

In my estimation, once you get to the point that you can't reasonably run out of money, you lose each year no matter how much more you could earn and invest.

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",PositivelyAmbivalent,I did this. I’ve been FIRE’ed for 2 years and a month now. I was able to go for 2 years before that but my job satisfaction went way up at that point because suddenly a lot of stress inducing things didn’t matter. I made some demands at work and they met them. So I stayed around longer. I’d say that the best thing about being able to FIRE is the freedom you have. Suddenly you have ALOT of control back in your life - control that ALOT of people NEVER get. If you still like your days then no need to quit!
1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",quetucrees,"How long is a piece of string?  


Personal circumstances are specific and what works for someone may not work for you.  


I fired at 45 but was working reduced/non conventional hours since 35 so that I would be home when the kids were not at school. When I fired the kids had only started HS so there was no possibility to travel extensively or move around often (part of our retirement plan). I just did sport for a year, got a bit bored, went back to school and started working full time doing something I really really like. We have at least 4 more years before the youngest can be in a position to leave the nest so I am having a blast at work and saving 100% of my take home pay for a fatter retirement (or to blow on toys, house deposits for the kids... whatever)"
1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",childofaether,"If you have such a disproportionately high income relative to net worth, I think it's sensible to target a conservative FIRE number.

3% SWR with 20-40% fixed income, make sure to count 1% of home value as yearly expenses for repairs, overshoot your expenses by one extra vacation if you like traveling, cash buffer of a couple years expenses on top of it. That way you're ready for anything the market does and you won't have to think about it even if the S&amp;P commits seppuku like the Nikkei. You'll have enough cash flow to withstand any storm.

Based on the numbers you've given, that would translate to ~80k expenses and 2.8M FIRE number, which would amount to 2 more years with the numbers you've given.

Imo it would be silly to not plan very conservatively with such a high post tax income, but when reaching that conservative FIRE number there would be no point working any more so I'd just quit even if income has ballooned to even higher numbers by then."

1907veh,"Hitting your FIRE number at high income and ""one more year""",lseraehwcaism,"The following data tells you that X additional years of work will get you Y extra yearly income in retirement based on $200k after tax take home pay and 7% growth adjusted for inflation.

1 year = $6.8k
2 years = $13.8k
3 years = $21.6k
4 years = $29.8k
5 years = $38.6k
6 years = $48.0k
7 years = $58.0k
8 years = $68.8k
9 years = $80.3k
10 years = $92.7k

Considering 3.25% SWR of $2MM is only $65k per year, only one extra year of work would bump your spending by $6.8k or approximately 10%. That’s a lot of money to put towards a hobby that you may not have been able to splurge as much on before.

I would not stop with a $65k income no mater what age. I would most definitely go an additional 3-4 years and reevaluate from there."
