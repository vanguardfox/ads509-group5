It’s the stop doing work that stresses you and is unfulfilling. Maybe you cut your income but so what? You won’t be saving as much but if you’re earning enough to not be burning you’re still growing the nest egg rather than depleting it. Just stretching the time till you start withdrawing will have a big impact. Take more vacations work fewer hours but still be productive.\n",
