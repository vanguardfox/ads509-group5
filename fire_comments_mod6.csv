1fqzb0p,What is your fire number? ,KONUG,"864k.

I live in Austria, and my current monthly expenses are around €1,000. This includes rent for a 70m² apartment, insurance, mobility (I live 5 minutes from my office and bike to work), groceries, holidays, hobbies, and more. I have no debts or loans, and I share housing and mobility costs with my girlfriend.

With expenses at €1,000 per month, I estimate that I would need €240,000 invested in ETFs to achieve FIRE, assuming a 5% net IRR (which would provide €1,000 per month).

However, I know I can't count on my expenses staying this low forever. For instance, if my girlfriend and I were to break up, I’d likely need a more expensive apartment. So, I’m estimating future monthly expenses at €1,800. To cover that, I’d need a portfolio of €432,000, which, with a 5% net return, would give me €1,800 per month (€21,600 per year).

That said, I also need to account for the risk of a 50% drawdown from being 100% invested in stocks and ETFs.

This leads me to my target FIRE number of €864,000.

Am I missing anything?

EDIT: I'll probably never stop working entirely. In about five years, I can see myself cutting back to 3-4 days a week. Then, in another 5-10 years, I might reduce further to just 1-2 days a week.

The thing is, as much as Seattle is awesome, the things I love here can be found elsewhere.

I want hiking trails and greenbelts and walking paths and parks and oceans or lakes and mountains and seasons and all that.

Still - when I look around for where else to go that has all this AND is far cheaper, I see Sweden as my top choice.

Why would we move to a MCOL city? The draw to be near family. That's really it. I can't tell you how appealing that is right before having our first kid, but leaving where we are now just isn't going to happen. We have a network of friends in the city and it feels like home where we are now. We've told ourselves we have to figure out where we'll be long term by the time the kid is about 4-5 and really starting to form friendships.

Honestly, our number would probably remain the same regardless of HCOL or MCOL. Suburban life is expensive. Bigger house full of more crap with 2 cars.

We might have had a beach rental week, a 9-10 day international trip, and a couple weekend or long weekend getaways. So the costs would involve flights (often paying for convenience), hotels/motels, dining out, activities/admissions. In planning for FIRE, we wanted to do a lot of travel, but doing in at the daily rate we used to didn’t work. So we had to figure a way to to take our pre-FIRE budget and stretch it to much longer. So far it’s worked well. A 6 week road trip across the US, camping each night, we spent less than we spend at home. A month+ long bicycle tour across Europe, I used miles to get a free flight, and spent about what I would have for a 9-day trip before. Again, camping really helped keep costs down. I got a room occasionally, but generally away from an expensive tourist area.

Our future plans involve some slow travel. Renting a house for a month or two in Spain, for example. We can get a monthly rate for about what a beach rental week costs at our coast.

Beyond that, in planning for FIRE, I tracked spending for a long while, and made adjustments based on best guess for how things would be once retired. Way less driving, for instance. No more lunch meals out. And less dining out in general because we have so much time to prepare meals. We also have time to hit multiple grocery stores. We made adjustments for having a paid off home, for health insurance (we pay well less for a silver enhanced ACA plan than our portion of our employer plan).

Once I had that worked out I add it to my base expenses (housing, food, healthcare etc.) I found it was important to separate base expenses from discretionary expenses.

z5a29v,What is your fire number and how did you arrive at it?,kenmcnay,"I use numbers from my quarterly report to determine an average annual budget for the household. During this accumulation period, it includes housing, saving, and charitable contributions, for example, that would change significantly after RE. It's imperfect, but grants a view of the current household situation. 

At this time, I'm anticipating a SWR of 4.5% to cover that average annual budget, so from my recent quarterly report that's around $2.6M as the average annual budget shows around $99K. However, using this method, the numbers change quarterly. Not much, but I do have another sheet that indicates the changes over time.

Around five years ago, I had an average annual budget about $72K and a FIRE number about $1.8M with a different anticipated SWR. As I have watched the numbers change I keep in mind that setting a rigid number too early would have been a poor judgment. Having a growing volume of data enables more prudent planning. 

I anticipate the mortgage will be paid, then replaced by another home, a rental, or a refinance with cash out (or some other scheme for keeping shelter overhead), and the average annual spending for housing now might not match. I anticipate saving much differently, but I have not determined credible numbers to consider for post-RE savings; maybe it would consist of quarterly travel plans or monthly massages. It's undecided, but most likely will become a lower number and more frequently liquidated rather than consistently accumulated. I base charitable giving primarily on income, so post-RE income will introduce a change to that budgetary category. I won't eliminate it, so I'll have to consider and determine my own measure of charitable giving when I no longer use income as a basis. 

Regarding your topic of travel, I have no major travel plans for post-RE lifestyle. I'm seeing my parents travel quite a lot; they have a vacation condo for trips away from home, but also plan lengthy slow travel trips away from home. My dad likes to cruise about once a year. Right now, I don't have a similar zeal for travel and vacation; I don't have a good feeling about a time share condo at all. But, my parents always advised against it too, until retirement. So, I just guess it will change and remain difficult to estimate until that time. 

My suggestion for estimation is to explore your methods of travel. You find the expense shockingly high? Try out other choices. See if it's good enough or enjoyable enough. For example, while I was traveling for business trips, I liked riding Amtrak despite the time. A flight would cost fairly similar and take less time, but I really enjoyed the train rides. I couldn't always afford the time for train travel to business engagements, but I had a few customers that easily enabled train commutes. Unlike my dad, I really don't like cruising. I want to try cycle touring (another response mentioned it); I've already been a bike commuter and bike camping with my kids. I might like cycle touring, but I'm still working on the bikes I intend to ride for touring. I've got to convince someone to join me too, so I've got two bikes I'm working on.",2022-11-26 15:25:58,2022-11-27 12:36:53

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,JarvisL1859,"While your situation is very unique, it’s very normal to have issues like this in a relationship. And the best thing is to discuss them to figure out the best way forward and to make sure you and your partner fully understand each other and there’s no resentment. 

Ultimately it seems to come down to the fact that you want a more luxurious lifestyle now that your income has risen (which is normal) but your partner does not want a more luxurious lifestyle and his income has not risen (b/c he’s FIRE)

This is some thing I think you guys can prob work out and definitely discussing compromising on lifestyle or redistributing domestic obligations is fair game. Or your partner returning to the workforce at least part-time if he’s open to that. Or you accepting the original simpler lifestyle you both had and saving the extra so you two could FIRE. Or even keeping it the way it is if you think that you can view the stuff you currently have a problem with as a compromise rather than a subsidy (which I think is a valid way to look at it but ultimately that’s up to you). I’m not saying you have to do any of those but those are the options that come to my mind first as things you could discuss in that conversation

I think your perspective is completely valid and a lot of people would feel the way you do. Especially normal people outside of the FIRE world

Trying to put myself in your partner shoes, I can see how he might be frustrated because he is probably looking for a very simple life with FIRE in an HCOL at that income level and now he may fear that you are bringing lifestyle creep. It probably does not feel to him like you all are subsidizing him but rather compromising between the simpler lifestyle he wants and the more luxurious lifestyle you want. He may not think that he should have to take on more domestic responsibilities just because you earn more money if he was happy with your lifestyle when you were earning less money (but this is another thing in relationships that couples should always discuss and be on the same page about so there’s no resentment).

Most important is to have a shared vision of what good looks like. 
- What does your living situation look like? 
- How often do you go out to eat? 
- How often do you travel? 
- What class of travel? 
- how often do you get new cars?
Etc. 

Then from this you back into the expenses. It’s often easier if you’re already living your desired life such that the expenses are more predictable for your FIRE# but if you’re not, you need to bake in those costs. 

I saw your version of good includes a dishwasher and his does not. Dare I say he’s being totally unreasonable and a dishwasher is absolutely a necessity haha (this also begs the question how would you fund a future potential home purchase? Does the 35k a year he’s using also include saving toward a down payment? 

So once you agree on these things, there may be some non negotiables for you (like the dishwasher) in which case what is it worth to you and can you fund that for yourself? The dishwasher isn’t the best example bc it benefits everyone but maybe for you there’s an annual $5k vacation budget. If he’s unwilling to meet you at that, you have to decide if the money is still worth spending for yourself. Maybe instead of traveling with him, you spend some of that vacation budget for yourself with your friends?


On the other hand if there’s a fundamental mismatch in a lot of these dimensions and you’re not willing to subsidize him, you guys need to split up. It’s bound to fester more resentment as you go. No point in wasting the time!",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-29 20:49:42

There is so much in this post. 10 years is a long relationship and it sounds like you already signed the lease and he also might not be keeping up his end of household stuff? I come back to 10 years of relationship, and if it has been good up until now suggest that you don't throw in the towel like some are suggesting.  

I would keep your agreement as you've made it for now with the 60/40 rent and otherwise split everything 50/50 for the next six months or year. Do not subsidize your partner, meet him where he is for a bit. If you really want something, and he doesn't, do it for just yourself. Your wants are valid. This might mean a quality of life that is lower than what you think you want. On the other hand, you might end up perfectly happy. 

If you aren't happy with restricting your lifestyle after six months or a year (there is nothing wrong with that, btw) then you probably aren't financially compatible and it may be time to move on from the relationship. 

Re: Household - if other than the rent you are 50/50 finances then you should be 50/50 housework. And since your partner is no longer working, it would be lovely if they took a bit more on than that (Maybe 60%?). I'm not saying it is a hard and fast rule and I don't think you should keep detailed track, but if you are coming home from work and pulling second shift cleaning and cooking then that is out of balance.  If his FIRE relies on your providing housekeeping services then that doesn't fly either.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,hungryl1kewolf,"When my partner and I met (both now 36), he was working, but had some health stuff come up and needed to stop working. Prior to this, he intentionally set his life up to be as low cost of living as possible. As a result, he had enough saved that he could comfortably live for a year without working. I don't know that he would have formally defined himself as on the FIRE path, but it was an eventual goal. 

I supported him, of course, who wouldn't for a medical need! When that all resolved and he found he was able to continue not working, I started to feel some type of way. I had to seriously interrogate for myself why that felt/seemed so different. A lot of it ended up untangling how we've been socialized, intentionally challenging expectations of others that were in the back of my mind, and considering why we value what we do under capitalism as a whole.

We were early in our relationship and decided we liked each other enough that it was time to have big conversations anyway. I was honest with him about how I was feeling and what my goals/hopes for my life are. I've since found out (thanks to lurking this sub) that I'm more of a baristaFIRE girlie. 

Our financial interests align enough that we decided it's workable. He also is super understanding and let's me openly talk about my frustrations when they do come up and notice I'm feeling some type of way. He doesn't hold it against me at all. We don't live together, but are actively planning to do so; current time-line will align with when I'm debt free and likely ready to batistaFIRE. 

He has since gotten a small monthly income, outside of his savings. This will mean lifestyle adjustments for both of us. He has accepted that I can't 100% gear down as far as he has, but I also know that to meet my financial goals I can't be rigid either. 

ANYWAY. All this to say, the feelings of confusion and resentment are normal and real. It's what you do with those feelings that matter. In my situation, we do have more similar goals then you two, but a very similar clash of the lifestyles.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Agile-Figure-8248,"I'll offer my two cents here, with the caveat that I don't know either you or your partner so take it with a grain of salt :p. First, it sounds from your post like some resentment is starting to build on your end - that's probably not great, maybe consider addressing that directly. Could be as simple as ""hey, I'm starting to notice feeling resentful because I'm contributing more financially and driving our quality of life. Can we talk about it and figure out what to do?"". 

To help with this conversation - consider his (hypothetical) perspective: he's always wanted to achieve financial independence at a modest quality of life. A decent-ish apartment, healthy food, modest material goods and little travel. He's happy with this, and the stress that comes with work is nowhere near close to being worth the marginal increases in quality of life additional income could provide. After working and finally achieving financial freedom, you now expect him (implicitly or explicitly) to make more money to help improve your quality of life. This would require that he go back to work, (potentially) decreasing his quality of life significantly, to purchase things that he doesn't see value in, doesn't really benefit from, and would prefer to live without. You see this as jointly increasing your quality of life together and ""accommodating him"", but is that really the case? Does he actually want the same increases in quality of life that you do? 

At the end of the day, your partner just does not make that much money compared to you ($35k/yr) and so will not be able to increase your quality of life financially. You may just have to accept that or move on to find a higher income earner. There's plenty of them out there.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-29 22:36:51

1. 50/50 split for all living expenses.  Because his income is lower than yours, this means your overall standard of living will be based on $70K household income rather than $115K, but because your half of the expenses will be low compared with your salary, this should allow you to save more money or allocate more for wants for yourself.
2. 30/70 split for all living expenses based on the difference in your incomes.  This is what a lot of couples do when their incomes are unequal - it allows for a higher standard of living based on the higher total income and allows both people to have money for savings and spending because the living expenses are percentage-based.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-29 20:02:50

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Nomromz,"I'm struggling to see the issue here. Even in marriages there is often an inequitable split of finances because one spouse makes a lot more. Someone will inevitably be ""subsidizing"" the living for someone else in a relationship when finances are shared. There are millions of single income households in the world. There are also millions of households where one partner makes $200k and one partner makes $75k. 

Your partner is contributing 35k/year. In these single family households, the partner who isn't working often contributes in other ways (usually by doing household chores and childcare). 

The only question is whether or not you are okay subsidizing your partner's lifestyle. It sounds to me like your partner was upfront that they would be making 35k/year for essentially the rest of their life. 

This would be completely different if your partner suddenly told you they didn't want to work anymore and all your plans together have changed. 

Good luck OP. Trying to split all costs in an equitable way will be impossible in any relationship with a large disparity in income.

If he were working and making $35k/year, would you feel this way and that it’s inequitable? 

Are you mad because things won’t be split evenly? Or mad that he planned things out so he wouldn’t have to work to maintain his lifestyle?

These are questions you need to ask yourself, and then sit down and have a larger conversation with him about what you both want out of life, because it sounds like it’s different things. 

Finally, do you have a retirement plan? Not even early, but just in general. The usual advice is to not increase your lifestyle and save extra earnings until you’re on the pathway to secure retirement. You have some math to do if you want increased lifestyle to understand how much money you’ll need to put away to continue that lifestyle when you hit retirement age (which for you may be the standard 65 or a bit older). If you don’t start saving and investing NOW, sustaining that lifestyle increase you desire gets harder over time.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,Jasperoid,"I personally know a couple with the exact same situation. My own parents. Dad is FIRE while Mom is a high earner who's still working in her late fifties since she likes her job.

Since my mom is the higher earner, obviously she would want to have a better quality of life, of course not just for her but for the whole family as well. Nicer house, nicer car, etc. Dad on the other hand is much simpler, happy with his 15 year old car, no need for fancy stuff. 

Main difference is my mom is fine with being the one paying most of the household expenses. Probably because my parents are married thus willing to share everything. And the lifestyle is something she wanted, not my father.

I feel that as long as the disparity in income and lifestyle wants exists. One side of the partnership will have to pay more in order for the relationship to work out. I can't imagine asking my partner to pay more in rent just because I want to live in a bigger house when they are perfectly fine with their current simple life. I'd rather just upgrade my lifestyle together at my own expense since I am the one who wants it.

Obviously, the best solution is to talk things out and come to a compromise. I'm sure he's willing to put out more money for the household but how far he's willing to go, is something you need to find out and he needs to communicate. Obviously, it still needs to be within his means. And don't bring up that you feel like you're subsidizing him, that will just get things off the wrong foot. He might not see it that way. If I were in his shoes, I would think that you might bring in too much of a lifestyle inflation and put in my FIRE in jeopardy instead.

Either you'd have to compromise by not asking too much of him, since his income is limited compared to yours or you'd have to be okay being the one paying more in the household. I just don't see any other way for things to work out. This is how my family resolved this issue.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-30 17:06:32

I've read some comments were op said she wants a to live in a nicer place than what mr.fire can afford, and to be fair if Mr fire can only afford a roach infested 1 bedroom, that is also not acceptable for op to settle. 

At that point I suppose op should pay the difference for the nicer place. 

But also what was Mr fire paying before he moved in with you. Even in the nicer place I would imagine his 50% cost is still cheaper then living alone.

Quality of life is important and honestly both parties should be on the same wave path. It doesn't work out well when one person what to live a middle class life with a vacation and and one person what's to live as cheap as possible.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-29 20:49:23

I’m not saying you should marry someone when you aren’t seeming compatible! I just mean what if you talked through all of your assets, liabilities and goals and considered what life would look like fully together. No split finances.

If he’s pulling 35k a year he’s got a good nest egg. What if he stopped pulling from it? What if you were the sole breadwinner and his retirement just grew until the two of you were at retirement age? Obviously that assumes the two of you can be a team until then, but pure numbers he would be contributing a lot to your finances and you would be contributing a lot to his and retirement would be a lot more “fat”.

1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,gr7070,"Being unequally tethered is perfectly fine in a relationship with shared expenses, whether finances are combined or separate. 

The problem i see for you is you have no protection like a married couple does. 

Someone has to subsidize the lifestyle with uneven earnings even if much of that lifestyle is your desire - that's a compromise made with marriage/partners. 

However, with it your income you have no claim to the others assets. You're essentially giving your future (sacrificed) investments to your partner now without protection. 

That's a risk I'm unwilling to take. 

Another question, why are they only taking $35k? That's a choice, that you again are subsidizing. 

Certainly they could take more granted they'd have to work some/more hours/more years before complete FIRE. That is a choice, though, that you are (somewhat?) burdened by, and again without the risk compensated for.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-30 01:13:48
1ef8jjf,How to split finances when one is FIRE'd and one isn't FIRE'ing,havenyahon,"OP, I've read through quite a bit of the comments and your replies and will try and give a perspective I haven't really seen discussed much. I think this isn't so much a finance issue as a psychological issue. You are worried you (will) resent your partner unless you get a fair split. But you're trying to work out in what way that split sounds fair to you, and your partner is resisting your attempts to do this in a clear and unambiguous manner because he doesn't want to 'financialise' your personal relationship, which is a fair way to feel.

People are getting caught up in the fact that 50/50 or 100/0 financial arrangements occur all the time between husbands and wives, and no one thinks the wife is mooching, or being subsidised, or whatever, but I think this situation is a bit different. In these relationships, usually the wife is doing all the chores, cooking, cleaning, etc, most of the looking after the kids. They're working just as hard on joint things for the relationship, or both partners are working just as hard in full time jobs and splitting the rest outside of them. This is a fair split because both partners are putting work into joint aspects of the relationship.

Your situation is different because you have partner that has saved/inherited enough money that they can get 'free money' without having to do anything. So your partner isn't putting 'just as much work' into the joint benefits of the relationship with their time. It's time they use for their own relaxation. It sounds like they're doing a few more of the chores, but not to the extent that they can be considered putting just as much work into the 'joint benefits' of the relationship as you, and this is why you feel the split is unfair.

So, when you think about increasing your financial contribution to upgrade both your lifestyles, which your partner is happy not doing, it feels unfair to you because this person doesn't seem to be working just as hard for the joint benefits of your relationship.

So if this is correct, the problem you have here is that:

1) Your partner has the right to use their money to have the 'lifestyle' they want, which it sounds like is one with a lot of free time. They shouldn't feel bad about this. If you were no longer in a relationship, and they would be living off the same amount, then this is a perfectly acceptable thing for them to want.

2) If you want an upgraded lifestyle from that, and you want them to share it with you, then you need to feel okay paying for it. You need to come to some psychology that doesn't lead to you feeling resentful due to unfairness. But...

3) You have deep feelings about what it means to 'work for the joint benefits' of your relationship and these need to be communicated to your partner so they can meet your expectations (or you need to get rid of your expectations). Otherwise you will always feel (and be correct) that they're not putting in as much work into the relationship as you are.

  
A potential way to resolution: If this person was doing work around the house, producing things for joint activities and hobbies, arranging gatherings/parties with their time, etc, would you feel better about paying more to upgrade both your lifestyles? Is your partner likely to do these kinds of things, or are they more likely to just use their time to focus on their own wants and needs? 

That may be the clincher in terms of whether the resentment builds over time. If they're not going to be putting in significant work for both of you, then you won't feel fair in devoting more of the fruits of your work, because there is no equal division of labour towards the joint goal of the relationship. You may not be able to stop yourself resenting them over time, because you'll never feel that the arrangement is 'fair' (and I think would be right), which means this isn't the relationship for you.",2024-07-29 19:33:52,2024-07-30 09:53:23

143o3y9,We’re all privileged,QuesoChef,"The biggest reason I want to FIRE is because of the system. I don’t make a crazy amount of money, like many (not all) here. I’m in my forties, so I’m not retiring crazy early (though the system wasn’t THIS bad when I was in my twenties, so no judgement). I give to charity. Not any amount anyone is going to gasp over, but I choose a charity or two I believe in and give. I also live life, doing things I enjoy today, but not doing everything I want to do, and also staying as far away from competitive purchasing (keeping up) as possible. 

But capitalism is the reason I want out. I don’t like coworkers who are backstabbing, always angling with their own agenda, seeking to get more so others have less, lying, manipulating, whatever. All of that dysfunction middle and upper management has. 

My company doesn’t have an absurd CEO to worker pay ratio. But I have been in meetings where those making very, very good money are complaining about the lowest paid who “think they need more” and how the company can’t afford it, but their bonuses are far more each year than paying those employees fifty cents or a dollar more an hour. And they aren’t giving that up, but the company survives. I’m sick of not having a voice or a say and just being a yes person who does the work for those around me to take credit. I’m tired of going into an office building everyday because the leaders are conservatives who think remote work is for lazy liberals (I could get remote work, but there are issues there as well, that’s not the point, the point is politics at work and how the people at the top have the biggest selfish and self-serving biases and they have the power - in all companies). I’m just tired of it all. It is exhausting. And the company wants more and more and more growth every year and more and more and more profit to drive growth. It’s not sustainable. 

The amount I’m trying to save is a fraction of what many here want. I don’t want a lavish life, I want a simple, peaceful, quiet life. A life where I have control of my very small corner to make it my own instead of worrying if my job will be eliminated to improve costs, or if I’ll be on a project I don’t understand that’s disorganized, ill-thought and my opinion isn’t allowed because I need to shut up and do what I’m told.

I’m tired and I’m ready to know I CAN walk away.

If youre questioning why others cant do what you do pretty much the same.

Capitalism is not a fair system. Its not a system that cares about the welfare of its people. Succeeding is an imperative because the system is awful. That doesnt make success an accomplishment or a good. Its simply a necessicity.

It is not privilege it is sacrifice and the children of those people are supposed to instill the same values and make the same sacrifices and teach their children the same lessons for future generations.  This exact ideology was part of the Federalist Papers.  ""Everything we hold we hold in fiduciary capacity.""  Sadly this mindset has been lost both on an individual level and a political level.  So many people just want to consume now and have no plan for their future.  They loom to the privilege argument and overlook their own shortcomings because any shortcomings are the result of the wider world not their own decisions.  At the end of the day there are people that strive to be Captains of their own ship and sail alone while others are content to be passengers and complain about the course of the ship they are on.",2023-06-07 20:32:38,2023-06-07 22:05:17

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,Ok-Range6432,"You are certainly correct that you should be able to retire at roughly 50.

I think your return estimate is a little too optimistic and your withdrawal rate is a little too aggressive.  However, with compounding, this ""error"", can probably be fixed with just an extra year or three of work OR with more aggressive saving in the next 17 years.

Some questions:

1) Are you buying a house?   Will that be paid off by the time you are 49?  If you own a home you plan to stay in, your inflation rate will not be 3% on $3000/mo.  It will be more like 3% on your maintenance cost and property taxes (maybe; not if in California or elsewhere that limits property tax growth).  If your maintenance budget is $500/mo, 3% inflation over 17 years only raises this to $826/mo.  Usually this maintenance will be lower, but you'll potentially need at least 2 new roofs before you're 80 years old.  If you can do a lot of maintenance yourself, your cost/mo can be much less.  Installing solar panels is another way to reduce the effects of inflation.  Maybe consider this the next time you need to replace the roof.

2) For the daycare, how many children do you have?   If that $900/mo is literally child daycare, that will go down significantly when they are in kindergarten and even more so a few years later.  A lot of public schools will have an afterschool program for $100 - $200 per month to cover 3pm - 6pm.  If you plan for this to continue at least to high school graduation as college savings, then this extra expense will go away by the time you are 53 to 55 (assuming the youngest turns 18 when you are 49 or younger and school takes no more than 6 years).  This $900/mo doesn't needed to be included in your long-term retirement expenses.

  
Normally, FIRE calculations do not inflation adjust expenses, but instead assume 6% or 7% net market returns after inflation (so, \~9% - 10% returns before inflation).   The 4% rule is using this math.

You can also estimate your social security payment if you lookup the benefit formula, current bend points (90%, 32%, 15%), and an estimate of your average monthly earnings over 35 years (use 0s for empty years).

  
My recommendation:

Time is literally money.  Do everything you can to save as much as you can in the next few years.  If your tax bracket is 22%, save an extra $2000 per month (+$1k each) into your 401k's if you can without exceeding $23k limit.   $2000/mo x 22% will save you another $440/mo if you don't drop down into the 12% tax bracket.   Use that extra savings (and more if available) to also max $7000/yr each into Roth IRA's.  If you're healthy and can do an HSA you can save another $8200'ish into the HSA and save another 12% to 22% in taxes. 

With leftover money, keep building your emergency fund up to 6 months (before maxing 401k if you don't already have at least 3 months expenses).

If one of your companies has a mega backdoor Roth, put any extra savings there.  You can withdraw contributions in 5 years after you contribute without penalties anyway.   This can grow untouched during retirement while you draw down 401k first.

If you save hard at least for the first few years AND the market does well / average, you may even be able to retire before 49/50.

  
Even if you retire at 49 or 50, when you turn 55, get a (part?) time job with a 401k with low-fee funds.  Then rollover your old 401k and any pre-tax IRAs into that 401k.  Now you can quit that job and use the rule of 55 to withdraw w/o the 10% penalty.   Certain public safety professions can use this rule as early as 50",2024-05-10 19:30:05,2024-05-10 21:25:36

Great plan, in theory. In practice, not so much. Everyone’s plans are idealistic. Life isn’t idealistic. It never goes as planned. There is always (always) something. Always. Often there’s many things. That’s just life. You’re correct about the LONG term and market increases, but that’s when looking at 30, 50 or even 100 year timeframes. Your plan is about 17 years. What if there’s a ‘lost decade’ at some point (fairly likely), that would instantly put your 49 target to about 60. Some suggestions seem to point towards a possible lost generation. This is just one of many things to factor in. Another would be timing, that your withdrawals may coincide with a bear period, or even a major life event or expense, which will hammer the principal more than you realise, and also reduce the base amount on which your capital is earning interest.

1coxxrq,How my wife and I will retire before 50; neither of us make over $75K,maythesbewithu,"Your initial plan has at least one serious flaw: using a fixed PMT calculator to compute future income does not account for how future income needs to escalate during retirement. 

Please use the right tool for the job. That payment calculator is fine for figuring out a car payment, but not for a retirement income strategy!

Example: your $8200 monthly retirement at age 50 will only feel like today's $3400 at age 70, and you will still have a decade of further declines until expected age at expiration.

Said simply, your future payments to yourself in retirement have to increase to keep pace with inflation. Retirement is a long time, so the increases over time are important to consider.

The other flaw is what many go through, a false belief that they can make in the market 2x what ""traditionally safe"" wealth extraction feels like. Anyone can make a retirement strategy look appealing when they use high returns and low inflation.

However, this is not a complete plan to actually retire at 49, but it is a step in the right direction. 

You can’t count on a 9% return rate. Some years may be negative. What will you do then?

I noticed you didn’t include health insurance, which can range from $300-$500 per month per person at 49. Will you work part time for health insurance?

Do you own your home?  Your rent may outpace inflation. For you to retire with 72K/year, it’s better to have 2M. The 4% withdrawal rate is no longer safe depending on other factors like inflation, your life expectancy, etc. It’s a rule of thumb but not precise enough to apply to everyone everywhere all the time. 

I’m not sure with the calculator you’re using, but that looks to be reporting nominal amounts. 1.43M will be great to have at 49, but it won’t have the same purchasing power as it does in 2024. Your calculations appear to be based on this.",2024-05-10 19:30:05,2024-05-11 13:38:15

1ffwmql,10 tips from my 20 year journey to financial freedom,ppith,"OP, 

We can relate.  The second we started focusing on investing outside of workplace retirement our accounts started growing rapidly.  We also use spreadsheets to track expenses and investments.  We started to invest more heavily in 2017 and focused more on after tax and Roth in the past few years.  I wasted a lot of my 20s with sports cars (they were fun, but they aren't investments).  We also wasted some years stock picking.  If I could go back, I would just have one sports car (instead of three plus two motorcycles) and only buy S&amp;P 500.

Our income is lower than yours as we didn't cross household income above $300K until 2022.  We save around $200K a year now.  Here are our smaller numbers:

March 2021 - NW $1M

June 2023 - $1M in investments 

August 2024 - $1.7M in investments.  Net worth $2.3M.

House paid off 2022, no debts now.  Like you, we pay cash for everything unless we can use a credit card.  We have a card with unlimited 2.625% cash back.  We used it to pay estimated taxes for safe harbor and our property taxes.  After fees, we still make a little money.  Our daughter is in kindergarten.  Wife wants to work until she's done with highschool.  We also don't flaunt jewelry, drive boring cars, though my wife loves getting some used clothes on Poshmark.",2024-09-13 14:50:25,2024-09-14 06:10:44

I stayed for the money, nothing more, letting me to do some crazy fun stuff and travel the world while still making real progress toward FIRE.  You can't do that in low income.

Here's the thing about taking a less stress / lower pay job.  If you're the kind of person who's used to moving up the ladder, that job won't stay low stress but it will stay low pay.  Your natural tendency will be to take on more work, more responsibility, to become that go-to person that the higher ups can rely on and... poof... you're right back to your high stress spot without the cash behind it.  

Not worth it.  Stay making the money and grinding, then get out and go your own way.

Here’s my two cents. You are going to get wrecked in any job sooner or later or always. Get paid for it or get nothing out of it.

I have seen people work weekends and to 4am and not get even 25% what big tech gives. I have seen some people on big tech literally do nothing for years, rest and vest and get 10M or more lol. 


Not all jobs are the same and most high paying jobs are demanding, because of the amount of people trying to knock you out of that position. I have seen directors get burnt and pushed out, while a regular senior that got in at the right time right place with the right rsu negations make more than a director will ever make lol


Example: getting in to meta two years ago or Nvidia and clocking in at 100 strike for the rsus. These batch of workers in any position are waiting to fully vest and are out. 

What you want to do is identify the two out of three glory hole. 

Pick two at best

1) get paid a fuck ton 
2) do something you like 
3) stress free and have lots of free time

You ll be lucky to find two out of three. Find three jackpot won’t last, reorgs will fuck you. 

There’s a 4) but you need to figure this ( health) love

1cmt0ah,Is toxic corporate culture why most of us want to Fire? ,alexunderwater1,"Yes. Corporate culture has only gotten worse and worse. I think like many things the pandemic fast forwarded that. 

That said, I think taking a sabbatical or mini-retirement once you reach a certain number really helps to reset your mind to give less of a fuck. It also gives you hard confirmation that you have actionable f-you money.

I took a year off to travel and shake out stress and burnout — I was to the point where I was having a lot of trouble sleeping because my mind would be racing about work the next day… I couldn’t turn it off. The long time off defining how I want to live and define myself outside of work made a huge difference after going back to work. If you are able to take a step back and not work for an extended period of time you’ll see how trivial jobs actually are and aren’t really worth stressing much over.  No one who has taken a sabbatical or mini retirement has regretted it, and it’s is often regarded by those who have as a life changing event on par with the birth of a child or a marriage.

I’m now at much higher paying job with higher expectations, and at an arguably much more toxic corporation that has even more threats of layoffs, but my stress has never been lower, because I simply give less of a fuck after gaining more of a perspective.

I encourage you to do the best you can in an 8-9 hour workday and then stop while keeping your leadership informed of what is delayed/not getting done because of team capacity constraints. In my case it turned out fine and I went from wondering how I’d make it even one more month without snapping to feeling I can handle this for a few years until my investments have enough momentum of their own I can take a real step back (hopefully long sabbatical into lower pay/less responsibility job) without setting my timeline back very far at all.",2024-05-08 01:54:13,2024-05-08 12:36:23

European leaders say the world is ""No longer in a post-war mindset, we are now in a pre-war mindset"". The leaders of the U.S. are so dysfunctional we cannot pass much needed legislations and protections against the financial and geo-political crises knocking at our door. 

Financial independence allows me to stay secure in an increasingly insecure world. As climate change continues to devastate communities indiscriminately, having the financial literacy and a life absent over-consumption I can focus on the simple things in life that truly bring me purpose and happiness. 

I am mid-twenties so the idea of working a job designed to benefit a world order that might not survive the dramatic climate change that is already upon us scares me.  They say, ""be careful what you get good at"" and I don't want to get good at the job I work today. I want to get good at gardening and community development. And only in ""retirement"" can I truly workday in and day out on things I am genuinely passionate for. 

I hope to be financially independent in the next 8-10 years, and able to ""retire"" in my 40's-early 50's.

I seem to have found a firm where the corporate B.S. is less stressful than other places I have worked at. The amount of company culture frustrations that come up are not too bad.

In my current position, my manager is a super high up guy making millions a year and his manager is basically the CTO. Like many super high up guys making millions a year, they can be demanding. So now I have to manage the people in my org (with a lot of the issues folks here have discussed, including personal ones*) as well as manage up. If anyone in my org fucks up, I hear from them. If someone complains about tech, even if its a useless complaint that even Tim Cook couldn't fix, I hear from them to go ""address the issue"", and of course when tech breaks, I am ultimately responsible. 

Have stress levels gone up? Probably not! I honestly feel it is less stressful to deal with a few people issues and some operational issues than get yelled at by traders losing money when their tech isn't working - but that's a terrible bar to start with. However, *quick wins have gone down* which is something I miss from my days being an individual tech contributor with a support rotation.

**I guess my TL;DR is: if you are good with people and you have a decent company culture, climbing up to management isn't so bad, but it's still a job with annoyances and ultimately I'd rather not work.**

1cmt0ah,Is toxic corporate culture why most of us want to Fire? ,entitie,"I went into people management in tech and managed for about 8.5 years.  I spent my final year not managing.  Both stress and income were monotonically related to how many people I was managing (income was maybe the logarithm of how many people I was managing).

Yes, it gets more toxic the higher you go. Some companies probably have a more healthy culture than mine, but I think the issue was that people who want more money are more ambitious, and so the people at the top tend to be (not always, but tend to be) those who are more self-interested and focused on money.  Occasionally they're old-timers who are there because they rode the wave even though there are more qualified people. It's difficult and very competitive to get promoted to the very top, and you tend to see competitive people up there, which is why it's toxic.

I generally suspect that the best managers are probably people who only reluctantly become managers.

Anyways, my advice would probably be to stick it out for a few more years as a manager but consider switching back to IC for a bit.  Being IC is a lower-stress role, certainly, and you'll last longer.

For example: retiring 7 years fully-burnt out doesn't seem as good as what might make you happier if you *could* retire in 11 years but decide to work for 15 years instead, because you love the work you're doing.",2024-05-08 01:54:13,2024-05-08 18:33:33

Retiring for most people will be leaving your job at your highest earning potential. It is a fate everyone will need to move on from. Giving up all you worked for.

Why stop at 60-65? Why not go to 67-72, hell at 75 think about how even MORE richer you will be..

These issues above will have you like most people, which is working long past you need to and potentially having regrets.

The fire movement is a shift of the above focus. You will have to practice this.

Right now you see FIRE as LEAVING your job. Which is why you are like its not so bad if I stay Ill be mega rich! You should be seeing FIRE as something to run TOWARDS to. Something to look forward to, having a plan of why you want to retire.

Otherwise you will be stuck in 1 more year in perpetuity. The same argument you are making now you can make until you die. Think of the reasons why you wont retire at 80 years old. And apply it age 70, 60, 50.

-20s:  invincible, social life maximized

-30s:  some minor body wear and tear accumulates, but otherwise still near invincible.  Social life begins to slow as people become more focused on family vs friends

-40s:  'middle age' start to appear and fitness no longer peak, but still fully functional.  Social life is relatively low.  Stress from starting to peak.

-50s:   full blown 'middle age', ache/pains more problematic.  Serious illnesses begin to appear.

-60s:  health starting to decline, but still fully independent and still do anything except maybe more extreme aspects of sports.  Serious illness becomes more common, especially in those who don't take care of themselves.  Social lives pick up again as kids leave the next.  Vacations/activities are now affordable and accessible; can't do quite as crazy stuff as when younger, but still can live the good life.

-70s:  I often see the 70s as the last good decade.  Health is declining and joint replacements /etc are common.  People are finally retired going on the vacations they always dreamed of, though they don't do as much as and starting to lose independence.  So vacations/activities become tame.  Death starts to become less uncommon at this age.

-80s:  Major health decline is common.  Major loss of independence.  Mixed bag on whether life is still 'good'.  Death is common.

-90s:   If you've made it to this point, you are a mix of lucky and took care of yourself.  Significant loss of independence.  Quality of life is typically not great.

  
The reality of life can be sobering.  Take advantage of the time you've got.  Be a good person and help people.  Don't perpetuate things that make life shitty for other people and next generations.

  
So, what is that huge pile of money really going to buy you, if you already have basics needs covered?  Then ask the question again if you are somewhere in the decline phase of life.",2024-04-19 17:38:05,2024-04-19 19:00:53

The marginal QoL improvement at each dollar amount will look different for everyone, but the general rule is going to hold true.  That is, while you might have a shit ton more money if you kept working until 65 vs. 58, would all that extra money actually be hugely useful to you or even your kids?

In 6 years, we could have regular low middle class FIRE. 


In 8 years, we could start to stretch. 


In 10 years, looking ok for a trip overseas every few years. 


In 15 years, we are chubby FIRE. 


In 20 years, we are wealthy.

1c82w4y,The cliff is steep: How do you choose to retire early when working 5 more years can bring so much more,One-Mastodon-1063,"1. Most things in life have diminishing marginal returns.  This includes money.
2. Traditional employment necessitates trading time for money
3. Time is finite.  The diminishing marginal returns thing doesn't really apply to things that are finite, or at least it doesn't apply in the same way.  If time does have a point of diminishing marginal return, I have not personally ever experienced it.
4. Quality of life diminishes with age.  There are things you can do at 40 that you will not be able to do at 65.
5. Kids are only young once.  You get one shot to spend time with them.  When you are 65, they will no longer be kids.  Leaving them a bunch of money when you are dead is not going to bring back the time you didn't spend with them when they were young.
6. Generational wealth is generally squandered by about the third generation.  This coincides with all sorts of other problems (addictions etc.) that come alongside unearned wealth.

Choose carefully.

I'm 43 and haven't worked in 2 1/2 years.  My kid is 6 (single dad, have him 50% of the time).  Yes, my net worth at death could be multiple times higher had I continued working until 65.  I had a high paying job so I still have enough money to have a pretty solid quality of life, definitely not a meager existence but also nowhere near as luxurious as it could be if I worked and spent most of my income like most people.  IME, unless you get caught up in the chasing status hamster wheel, in which case no amount of money will ever be enough, you'll eventually get to a level of spending where it's like ""this is good enough, I'd rather have more time than more spending money at this point"".",2024-04-19 17:38:05,2024-04-19 18:20:39

You either work, or you're retired. But it doesn't have to be like that if you don't want to. When you've hit your first goal around 50, you can take it easier. Still work, but take more (unpaid) time off. Change to different job that is less stress and less hours. Or keep the job and income you have, put all your earned income in stocks and start living off 4% each year. Then the next year you do the same, and the next. As you still keep pouring money into your portfolio, and hopefully you'll get great returns as well, you'll start to get to a point where your income has reached a point where more money doesn't really change anything in your lives.

Looking at my own spreadsheet, at about 43 I can realistically retire. But at 67, I could retire with 10x that amount to spend.

1c82w4y,The cliff is steep: How do you choose to retire early when working 5 more years can bring so much more,jlcnuke1,"I **can** retire now. That gives me around $60k/year spend plus enough to afford the sailboat I want to buy myself for retirement. As a 47m, that's plenty for me. My retirement home (currently housing my dad for his retirement, I bought it for him and my mom when they couldn't work anymore and the plan is I'll retire there someday as well) will be paid off in 3 years (2.5% interest rate, not interested in trying to pay it down early and losing the PI payment amounts would be a nice buffer on my expenses if we have a bad sequence of returns at the start of my retirement.

You'll note I didn't say I **am** retired though. That's simply because my work situation for this year ended up being 95% amazing, low effort and low time, and only 5% typical work stress and headaches.

Now, if I waited until I was 54, I'd probably be able to spend $100k+ per year instead. That's a lot of extra charity, ability to help family, more luxuries, and pretty much not having to pay attention to what I spend at all for me (mcol area, low mortgage, car paid off in August).

If I waited until I was 60, geez, I'd probably have $160k+ available to spend, more than I ever made in a year in my life.

So, why am I retiring before my birthday next year?

Simply the things I want to do in retirement, scuba dive, sail around the world, travel, hike, see new cultures and experience them and what they have to offer can be done comfortably for what I have, so why spend another 5, 10, 15 years doing a job I don't care for, for people I don't really care for or respect, simply to have more money that I don't need?

I also have diabetes, and thanks to stress for a number of years drank too much, so my life expectancy and anticipated health in later years isn't great, so the idea of waiting another 10-15 years to try and do what I want sounds like a recipe to come here and post:  
""I waited to long to retire and now I don't have the health needed to do what I wanted to do in retirement so I sit at home or go to doctor's appointments these days instead"".  That's the reality for a lot of people in their 60's, honestly. My mom's health got too bad to work before she hit full retirement age, and most of her retirement ended up spent barely able to walk before she couldn't even manage that anymore.

If you have something to ""retire to"", then sticking around for more money you don't need really needs some kind of incentive. Mine happens to be a lot of free time to do things preparing for my retirement (language learning, learning to play guitar, research on the boats I may buy, etc.) while still having lots of free time for my hobbies and enjoyment (I get over 8 weeks vacation per year, so this year includes diving in the Galapagos, cave diving in Mexico, a week in the Bahamas with friends, scuba diving in Roatan Honduras, and a few weeks I haven't bothered planning anything yet. Plus a number of concerts, trip with friends to celebrate some of them turning 50 in Vegas, etc.

So this year is 85% retirement already, while they still pay me full time, so sticking around for a year of prep seemed reasonable. I wouldn't do it for a second year unless the market just tanks between now and then though.",2024-04-19 17:38:05,2024-04-20 03:01:28
1c82w4y,The cliff is steep: How do you choose to retire early when working 5 more years can bring so much more,PaulEngineer-89,"Yes, it should be a “cliff”. It’s exponential growth. Say you max out your 40-k’s at $46k for a couple and you have $1 MM. At 10% growth it grows $100k so your contribution is 31.5%. Once it doubles 6-7 years later your contribution is now 19%. And if you just stop contributing completely it only adds on 2-4 years. This is far different from making retirement contributions in your 20’s when 90%+ of the growth is your contributions.

But…I’m having second thoughts about Fire or even Barista Fire.

My process from creating this:

1. Current annual spend estimates in several categories: rent, groceries, dates/entertainment, international travel, domestic travel, utilities/bills, transportation, hobbies, clothes, healthcare

Note: if I know these at a weekly or monthly level, I put that in and multiply by 52 or 12, respectively

2. Back check my budget above against actuals by looking at my paycheck take home, minus non expenses (Roth IRA contribution for instance)

3. Make a future retirement budget (or family of budgets) including any changes. I increased health care, travel, and dates, for instance. Keep this in today's dollars, because you likely won't know what year you can retire at this stage in the process.

4. Use a SWR you feel comfortable with (typically between 3.25 and 4%) that accounts for investment gains and inflation. Divide by that number you have your fire number.",2023-01-09 17:23:47,2023-01-09 18:21:07

107k4by,"How did you come up with your FIRE number? What is the best calculator, way to get at it?",GoodNightBadSalmon,"I multiple my number by 30 to be slightly more conservative, but also have a nice, round number (I'm far enough away that I have plenty of time to hone this once I'm closer). However, I intend to fire before our house is paid off so I've started basing my number off of my annual expenses + tax + estimated remaining mortgage when I fire.

For example, since I have a \~$2k/month mortgage payment at 2.75%, I'm not in a big hurry to pay it off early. So if I expect to have $150k left on the mortgage when I FI, and let's say my annual spend plus taxes is $100k right now (including the mortgage payments), I can consider my fire number as:

30 x (100k - (12 \* 2k))) + 150k = 2,430,000

Which is **30x** (**total current spend** \- **annual mortgage cost**) + **remaining mortgage balance at FIRE**. So that number would be **2.43mil**, and would account however I want to handle the mortgage - either a lump sum payoff or hold onto it - when I FIRE. 

One could argue that you could do the same math at 25x instead of 30x and still be using somewhat conservative numbers, since that extra 150k will have time to grow and will likely springboard you to additional returns if you don't use the lump sum 150k to payoff the mortgage upon FIRE. That math would work out to **2.05mil**, so it's significantly lower. 

Not sure if that helps you, but that's how I think of things. Unfortunately, I'm a long enough way off that I won't have to worry about the exact number for some time though lol",2023-01-09 17:23:47,2023-01-10 04:19:15

Last year I went to every concert and play that came to our city, including The Lion King, Matilda, Madame Butterfly, Swan Lake, Phantom of the Opera, Backstreet Boys, Ed Sheeran, James Blunt, Bryan Adams, Hans Zimmer 2 nights in a row. Visited my family back home, went on holiday to London and saw every play including Harry Potter and Wicked and a comedy play starring Lee Mack, and did a MASSIVE shopping spree including buying myself 4 pairs of shoes and a Berlutti laptop bag, and earlier this year bought a Lamborghini Huracan. The only thing I didn't do was pay for business class flights. I spent more in the past year than my basic salary. Oh and I've also quit due to stress so I'm currently on an indefinite sabbatical. 

Next month I've bought tickets to see The Corrs in London (an absolutely unattainable teenage dream which I thought I had lost forever since they had basically retired) with a supporting act none other than Natalie Imbruglia. Truly a once in a lifetime dream come true. And I'm flying over especially for the concert.

I've decided that if I work bloody hard to FIRE, I might as well go all out to enjoy life a little and capture all the unforgettable opportunities that may come my way. And honestly I wouldn't do anything differently. I can scrimp a little in my 60s, but while I'm young enough I'm gonna enjoy my life.

1fw9l5k,Never go full spend?,BuySellHoldFinance,"&gt;The year we hit our FIRE number, we both continue to work for one more complete year. However, in this year, we spend everything we bring in. And I mean EVERYTHING! Vacations, fancy dinners, nice clothes, big gifts for friends and family. Hell, even a new car if we can. I'm guessing we'll be HHI around $400k by this point, but I want to spend all our take home pay for one year.

I don't think there is any downside here if you've hit your fire number. Others are talking about lifestyle creep, but I don't think there will be any. You trained your brain to save for years and years. One year of higher spending won't wipe that muscle memory away.

&gt;I'm even on the fence on contributing to get 401k match. 

Really depends here. If you have enough in your taxable brokerage, passive income from dividends should be enough to let you contribute while still technically spending everything.

&gt;And not withdrawing for a year will let that grow even larger. That maybe gives another $25k+ to spend.

Your withdrawal rate is around 250K? At 3.5%, I'm guessing your ""number"" is around 6-7 million. I'm just working backwards from the 25k number here...

&gt;A slight financial upside of this, we pad ourselves on some fo the regular spend items before RE. Exanple, if I re-do my wardrobe in this year, I can lower my WR slightly once FIRE because I won't need any new clothes for a few years. Or if we buy a new car, we won't have maintenance costs for a while vs keeping our older current cars.

There is financial upside to working an extra year, that is correct.

&gt;I realize from a financial standpoint, this isn't smart in any way. But FIRE is just as much about the numbers as it is about enjoying life. Is this a horrible idea? What should we do differently to live large for a year? Do you think the juice is worth the squeeze?

I would say that working an additional year is always a net positive for your finances since it's one less year you are using from your assets and one more year to let your assets grow. So it doesn't seem to be a horrible idea. I would encourage you to enjoy your life right now instead of waiting until you hit your fire number.",2024-10-04 20:55:47,2024-10-04 21:54:54

A couple other tangential ideas:

* Live normal lifestyle for 11 months per year.  Save up extra income and blow on month-long extravaganza vacation (e.g. rent a penthouse or a villa or a chateau, fly family members with you, perhaps even charter a private jet).
* Let's say you reach your FI number and decide you like working well enough and want to work X more years.  You end up with an extra million.  You could put that million in a separate account, wait 10 years (you could use nominal values, so in theory the doubling time would be ~7 years on average given stock heavy portfolio) or until it doubles to $2M, then spend a million in that year.  Then wait until it doubles again and have another million-dollar-year.  Rinse and repeat until death.

1fw9l5k,Never go full spend?,KCV1234,"My anti argument would only be that it’s actually hard to spend that much money. After decades of saving and being smart, it’s really hard mentally to just turn around and ‘blow’ it. You’ll always have in your mind you could be saving it.

Also, it doesn’t actually do anything for you, buying that car saves you future maintenance, but having the money to pay for the maintenance is the same thing. Having the money to buy clothes when you want, is probably better than having a closet full of new clothes.

With that being said, I have thought similar. Once I’m ready to retire, work a bit longer to finance my retirement toys. Buy the RV, build out a workshop, spend what I would have in my early retirement years with new money so I have more later.

In reality, it’s just another way to fall into the ‘one more year’ trap. Might be fun though.",2024-10-04 20:55:47,2024-10-05 04:11:30

I think having a blow out year is likely to seriously encourage lifestyle creep. If you do a ton of great things and buy a ton of great things, won't coming back down to what will be the new normal of not doing that be a hell of a downgrade?

If you both desire all these things and you don't mind your jobs, why not adjust your FIRE numbers to suit that lifestyle? Seems like what you actually want in retirement is more than you've budgeted for so far. If that's the case, your current FI number doesn't actually give you FI.

I like all your numbers and your attitude about things.  I think you got it figured out.  Sounds like your plan then is to probably burn down your cash/investments until the IRAs kick in 12 years right?  1M today will probably be at least 3M by then, so burning it down would be a-ok.  3M at age 59 plus your SS when it kicks in, even if it isn't much, would give you more than enough money.

One thing:  Are you factoring in the depreciating value of your SS payments in 15 years?  What you are set to earn is based on where you're at today with an assumption that you'll keep working.

If you make enough that your kids don't work and then give them all the money when you die, they might blow it all. And at that point what did it do?

1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,AotKT,"I'm the child of parents who grew up poor but worked hard and got lucky with some unintentional market timing and will likely be leaving me and my sister each a couple million, which won't really affect either of our lives' significantly by the time my parents pass because we're both on track for FIRE too. My sister is 10 years younger and grew up with tropical vacations whereas I had camping. She got brand name stuff, I got library books. She is NOT spoiled because my parents made education a top priority, insisted on both of us doing chores and getting small jobs if we wanted spending money as teenagers (I babysat, she babysat and worked at an ice cream shop) and also we were pre-helicopter era so we both had to become really independent.

Where the wealth has come in handy for generations is in targeted spending on the kids. I put myself through most of college when I could go part time and work full time in ye olden days when that was possible, but my parents paid for the last 4 quarters that required me to go full time so I had zero college debt. They put my sister into an amazing secular private school growing up that I had qualified for but even with some scholarships my parents still couldn't afford; the quality of her education was amazing and directly led to her going to a top university for undergrad and an even better one for law school. One time I moved back home for 3 months in between apartment leases so I didn't have to pay the exorbitant month to month rent. My husband and I paid for our own small, simple wedding so my parents bought our honeymoon and all we had to pay was our incidental expenses and the upgrade to business class from coach. When my husband and I bought our first home, my parents gave me a substantial down payment gift with written proof that the gift was just for me. When we sold our home years later, that equity came back to me, which was a nice bump to my post-divorce finances. In between all that are small things like paying for a flight for me to visit or a family vacation somewhere nice. I can afford that but I wouldn't visit as often if I had to pay each time.

In other words, the amount you need to spend to make a huge impact in your kids' lives is really negligible compared to what you think: enough to keep them out of (smart) debt, to open doors to opportunities for career advancement and life joy, and to create experiences of shared time together.

Personally in your situation, I'd quit when your wife goes on maternity leave and use the time to spend with your kids. When the kids are in school, one or both of you can always go back to work. Even if you make significantly less because of the gap in your work history, it's still going to help pad the financial security.",2024-08-11 21:13:19,2024-08-12 08:59:23

1epvngp,Building generational wealth vs FIRE 10 years early?,JarvisL1859,"It looks to me like you all are in great shape and this might not be such a binary choice. Even if you FIRE soon, assuming you have a reasonably moderate safe withdrawal rate a lot of the assets will be left over for your kids to inherit. Also, you could push it back a few years instead of an entire decade. Overall I would encourage you to think more in terms of a spectrum than a binary here.

Ultimately it’s really more a question of how much— how much longer you work, how much you withdraw annually, how much you want to leave behind. I would just do some simple modeling with FIRE calculators to answer these questions.

Still, I would be tempted to keep working if you all are happy in your careers. I think hitting escape velocity is very tempting and that would give you increased flexibility in retirement, almost fat FIRE, as well as the possibility of leaving a lot behind. Especially if you are going to have a normalish life where you stay in one place and are not nomadic once you have kids. But on the other hand I have heard that people sometimes want to FIRE when they do have kids because they want to spend more time with the kids so that might be your experience too idk

Also, if you FIRE in your mid-thirties, you will need to have enough to support yourselves for 50 or more years. That budget will need to include medical expenses and live-in helper costs in the event you get sick.

I suggest that you work out what your annual spending will look like when you FIRE, including education costs for your future children. Most likely you will want them to go to good private schools and then good universities, all of which is expensive. Best to estimate on the high side, all told.

Then, set your FIRE figure based on a 3% withdrawal rate to be conservative, given your probably long remaining lives and your likely future wish to leave behind money for your children (which may strengthen after you actually have children).

Don’t forget to factor in taxes on your investments.

At most your child would be 3-4 years old event on your 5 year plan. Babies and or young kids can travel well at that age if you are OK with the adventure of it.

By the time my son was 6 he had traveled though the US a fair amount. He had been to Canada 2 times, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Spain. Additionally we Rved from the southern US into Baja spent 2 months driving the pensila and then 4 months between AZ, MT and ID (during covid times). 

He did great for all of these trips. 

Figure out what works for yall and honestly the child will likely adapt and thrive due to having parents that are engaged in their life, well-being and happiness.",2024-08-11 21:13:19,2024-08-12 14:45:58

At their core, lotteries are selling you a dream. For 2$, you get to imagine what you would do if you had 10 million. 

It’s easier to imagine when there’s a real (but very small) chance it might happen tomorrow. So I get the appeal.

Buying a ticket simply confronts you with the sudden possibility of acchieving financial freedom TODAY versus investing for many years until you can FIRE somewhere in the future.  It's not about how big that chance actually is. Buying a ticket might make you think more deeply and more concrete about the reasons why you actually want to FIRE and that might even increase your motivation because buying that ticket might force you to define what's really important for you.

But I also like the authors more general approach: Buy the ticket, start daydreaming what you would do and what you would change IF you win, BUT THEN actively starting to move your life in that direction even without winning. That could mean ramping up your savings rate but it could also be anything else, it's about getting motivated to actively improve your life in whatever way you desire.

1d9zkup,What is you fire number?,ReallyBoredMan,"3.3 million, SWR 100K, so SWR of 3%.

We should get there in around 11 more years, which lines up with when our house will be paid off (refinanced into a 15-year mortgage back in 2020 at 1.999% rate). I'll be around 45. I could delay until the kid goes off the college, so that would delay it a few years, but this is our rough plan.

100% equities. I plan on having 2 years of cash reserves,  but right now, I don't consider my cash as part of my fire number as it is just my emergency fund.

At the time of fire, I would likely have about 6% cash and everything else in equities. The cash would be on top of the 3.3 million portfolio.

The 100K spend is above our minium threshold. Actual expenses I think around 45K-55k (assuming no travel), but we are looking to get into ChubbyFIRE and have the extra float for activities and travel.

Lowering our spending for a year or two would allow for the 200K cash to go as far as 3-4 years - and that assumes we are still eating out as much as we do now. With more time cooking food, we could drop it even more.

We have a lot of safety nets that would be in place. The ultimate goal is that when we pull the trigger and FIRE that we wouldn't HAVE TO go back to work, if we decide to work part time or whatever for work we enjoy that would be fine. We don't want to be put in a situation where we are having to go back to work, likely at a much lower overall rate just to avoid digging too deep into our portfolio. We know 40s and 50s are peak earning years, so we want to make absolutely certain we are good with the decision.",2024-06-07 02:07:25,2024-06-07 09:23:10

1fgq5s0,How are you modeling the potential for senior care in your FIRE number?,Zphr,"Memory care in many places currently runs between $70K/yr and $120K/yr, depending mostly on the quality of the facility and accomodation choice.  It's not cheap, but also not that pricey considering the price includes most living expenses.  Fundamentally it's just another variant of LTC, but it's definitely not normally hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.

LTC, including memory care, is always a wild card and can be rather expensive. Indeed, it's so costly that even the LTC insurance market can't properly price and actuarially model for it with great accuracy, hence the persistent decrease in benefits and increases in premiums relative to payouts we have seen as the LTCI industry has matured.

A large HSA is perhaps the best LTC mitigation strategy there is after simply being wealthy enough to not care about such costs. The fact that one of life's largest costs can be paid for with triple or quadruple (if you got the FICA break too) tax-advantaged dollars is a huge win.

We have a sizable HSA that will provide us with ample tax-advantaged funding for LTC. We will also evaluate available LTCI options when we get closer, but I'm not hopeful there will be anything worth buying.

If we happen to run through our HSA, then we have our primary portfolio to lean on as well as each other and four loving kids who all seem likely to become responsible, financially successful adults.

If all of that fails to be sufficient, then there's really nothing else that could reasonably be done other than working several extra years purely to derisk a low probability scenario.  I don't see any plausible scenario where we would ever need to or be able to use Medicaid.

Also, unless you buy into a secured contract with a high-end facility that will allow Medicaid transition upon asset depletion, then most LTC places that take Medicaid alone are not anywhere you would usually ever want to be.",2024-09-14 16:34:56,2024-09-14 17:04:09

1) I’ll hopefully be of sound mind as I get closer to the age where I need to be concerned about dementia and elder care and can set up myself (or my family) at that time. Creating trusts, divesting myself, etc.

2) If I truly have dementia, I’m not sure I’ll actually care about my net worth, or anything else for that matter. It’s a very serious, debilitating, and sad disease. I’ll have hopefully set myself up via trusts prior to this so that I don’t go through all the money I had and can leave some to others. However, if I _do_ go through all the money I have, I doubt I’ll be of mind to even know. I just hope I’m nice and care for those around me during that time (rather than hateful &amp; paranoid that tends to come with the disease), should I ever be in that position.

So, to answer this - I’m very much wanting to be set up in wealth by 80 and ongoing. However, after 90, well, here’s hoping.

If you are trying to model away to save and invest enough money for worst case, end of life experiences, you'll never get there. In the American healthcare system bills can mount into the millions with a snap of the fingers. 

So take the advice of the author of die with zero. Don't worry about it. Live your life the best way you can. If things ever gets so bad that you need end of life care, the end is near anyway.

We discussed placing her in a facility but quickly realized moving her in with my family was a better option for several reasons. Mainly, it is cheaper for her, income for us and she receives better care from me than she would at a facility ( considering her current level of functioning and relative health stability). We believe this provides her with the best “retirement” she could hope for given her disabilities because she spends every day with her young grandkids, goes out to lunch with friends or goes for shopping and manicures with her sister. This arrangement also enables us to preserve her estate, basically only spending the interest it earns, so we have money to care for her well at the end of her life and possibly some inheritance, though this is a secondary concern.

a. Save enough for retirement and have high enough SWR to live on or pay for LTC in lieu of daily expenses.

b. legal preparation for Medicaid qualification via various trust use set as you get older. There are many nice and decent Medicaid LTC facilities and unfortunately, some horrid ones to avoid. These strategies protect the spouse and assets the most.

c. Pray for in-community Medicaid being enough full time care.  This will end when one abled skilled person at a time is not physically enough to care for you.

d.  Combined with option A, sell primary home so that equity can be used in addition to SWR.  This is challenging when a spouse is alive unless downsizing releases enough equity.

To date, we have collect $75,000 on Dad and $179,000 on Mom.   Mom has been in for a little over 4 years.   They bought this policy when they were mid to late 50s.   Honestly, I don't think that they will ever get ahead of it if you would have considered growth potential on the money they invested.   Dad is at that point, where on his next audit, they may decide to not cover him.   That's not going to be a good day.   He won't go to assisted living because of the reasons the OP states.   If he's not going to get full care, and he still has to pay a premium, he's going to go home.   That's just the way he is.   His mind is 100%.

How much risk are you willing to accept (of either running out of money or of working longer than you had to)? What income and resources are available to you?

1fjsi5g,"From the experience of people in here who have achieved FIRE, in hindsight, what would you say is the the most optimal  way to achieve it? ",TraditionalKale6025,"It's great you're thinking about FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) and exploring different investment strategies! There's indeed a lot of information out there, and what works best depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and FIRE goals. 
Let's break down the two strategies you mentioned and discuss their pros and cons:
**Strategy A: High Risk Early, Transitioning to Conservative**
**Pros:**
* **Potential for Higher Returns:** Historically, equities have outperformed bonds over the long term. Starting with a 100% equity allocation in your 20s allows you to maximize exposure to this potential growth during a time when you have a longer time horizon to recover from market downturns.
* **Time for Recovery:** Younger investors have more time to recover from market fluctuations, making a higher risk tolerance potentially more suitable.
**Cons:**
* **Volatility and Emotional Impact:** 100% equity portfolios can be highly volatile. Experiencing significant market downturns early in your investing journey might lead to emotional decisions (like selling low) that could harm your long-term returns.
* **Sequence of Returns Risk:** As you approach retirement, experiencing a significant market downturn could severely impact your withdrawal strategy and require you to delay retirement.
**Strategy B: Building a Yield Base, Then Shifting Aggressive**
**Pros:**
* **Income Generation and Compounding:** Focusing on yield-bearing assets early on provides a steady stream of income that can be reinvested, potentially leading to significant compounding over time.
* **Psychological Comfort:** Some individuals find the stability of income-generating investments more comforting, especially in the early stages of their FIRE journey.
**Cons:**
* **Lower Growth Potential:** Yield-bearing assets typically offer lower returns than equities, potentially slowing down your path to FIRE, especially in a low-interest-rate environment.
* **Inflation Risk:** If the yield generated doesn't outpace inflation, your purchasing power could erode over time.
**Finding the Right Balance**
Instead of viewing these as two completely separate strategies, consider a more balanced approach:
* **Age-Based Allocation:** A common approach is to use a target-date fund or a similar strategy that automatically adjusts your asset allocation based on your age. These strategies typically start with a higher equity allocation and gradually shift towards bonds as you get closer to retirement.
* **Risk Tolerance and Goal Setting:** Honestly assess your risk tolerance. How comfortable are you with market fluctuations? Define your FIRE goals clearly. What are your desired retirement age and income needs?
* **Diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes (equities, bonds, real estate, etc.), sectors, and geographies to manage risk.
* **Regular Review and Adjustment:** Your financial situation and goals will evolve. Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your strategy as needed.
**Remember:**
* **FIRE is a Marathon, Not a Sprint:** Building wealth takes time and discipline. Focus on consistent investing and making informed decisions.
* **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor who can help you create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances and goals.
Ultimately, the ""best"" strategy is the one that aligns with your individual risk tolerance and financial goals and allows you to sleep well at night knowing you're on track towards achieving FIRE. ",2024-09-18 13:13:52,2024-09-21 07:58:18

It makes sense in the individual communities devoted to each since those are lifestyle-based and have some limited specific financial concerns, but elsewhere it's all just FIRE or not.

If someone is at their chosen SWR, then they've reached FIRE.  If not, then not.  Nobody other than them cares if their preferred annual spend is $60K or $600K.

To the extent people want a measurement yardstick, the FIRE metric for measuring actual progress is withdrawal rate, not withdrawal amount.  Someone spending $300K a year at 5% is a hell of a lot less securely FIRE'd than someone spending $150K a year at 2%.  Even the dollar figures don't tell you much about actual lifestyle since the $300K budget could be significantly less luxurious in a VHCOL than the $150K budget is in a MCOL.

LeanFIRE is the only one that is meaningfully unique because that community focuses on frugality/minimalism, plus being low on the AGI scale dramatically ups the yield from the government via things like the tax code, ACA, and FAFSA.",2024-05-27 15:47:08,2024-05-27 16:31:44

Is the income gross or net taxes? And are you assuming the income goes entirely into expenses that an individual or family would necessarily take on once FIRE'd?

Tying the definitions to expense percentiles would be a much more useful proxy in deciding which FIRE one would like to aim for.

For example, I found this that shows US spending statistics for households aged 18 to 100: https://personalfinancedata.com/compare-your-expenses-to-the-national-average-by-age/?min_income=1&amp;max_income=1000000&amp;min_age=18&amp;max_age=64&amp;fam_size=any&amp;expenses=3000#results

Using the FatFIRE (90-percentile) definition you provided, that would correspond to $8,924/month spending, or an annual $107,088. This is much lower than $216,056.

I'm ignoring things like taxes, but even accounting for that, the expense would still be much lower than $216,056.",2024-05-27 15:47:08,2024-05-27 16:40:45

These numbers assume the 4% Rule, but that’s a forecasting rule, not a prediction of what will actually happen in retirement. In reality, you’ll almost certainly have much more to spend than the 4% rule suggests.

For example, someone with $1.85M in investable assets should assume a conservative 74k for planning purposes. But in actual reality, they will (on average) earn roughly double that, putting them firmly in the ChubbyFIRE spending range.

This is generally true across the spectrum. If you save enough to guarantee a 4% SWR at one level, the chances are good that you’ll actually have enough to live at the next higher level.",2024-05-27 15:47:08,2024-05-28 15:16:08

Investment income is not taxed for Social Security and Medicare like wage income is so, for example, you don't need $74,202 in FIRE income to match a worker in the middle bracket. Rather, you would need about $69k. Also relevant to note that income on a Roth IRA is never taxed so if most of your retirement assets are in a Roth you would need to draw only about $59.4k, for the years after 59.5, to have an equivalent amount of after tax spending money. For after tax funds too it will be taxed as capital gains, not regular income, so the comparison becomes a bit more complex. There are loopholes to minimize taxes on capital gains such as running winners and selling losers and, also, keeping your income low enough to get the 0% rate on most of them.",2024-05-27 15:47:08,2024-05-28 15:49:30
